SECOND TO NONE.

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
MARCH TO DOL.
</h3>

<p>
The city of St. Malo was now more
closely reconnoitred by the commander-in-chief,
as well as by General Elliot, the
quartermaster-general, and other officers,
who were unanimously of opinion that,
from its vast strength, a long time&mdash;a
month at least&mdash;must elapse before it could
be reduced; and as the heavy cannon and
mortars requisite for such a siege were yet
on board the fleet, the idea of any assault
upon the place should be relinquished,
more especially as French troops were
advancing against us from Normandy,
Maine, and Anjou.
</p>

<p>
The approach by land to the small isle
of Aaron on which it is situated is by a
mole or causeway, three-quarters of a mile
in length, by fifty-four feet in breath.
and this was daily covered by the tide with
slimy weeds.
</p>

<p>
The approach by sea was narrow, well
defended by batteries, and was otherwise
dangerous to vessels venturing within
gunshot.  On the north St. Malo was
quite inaccessible, in consequence of the
height of the rocks and strength of the
fortifications which crown them.  The
city was crowded with fugitives from the
adjacent country, from which they had
retired by order of the noblesse,
magistrates, and echevins, to whom the Duke
of Marlborough* sent a notice, that if
the peasantry did not return peaceably to
their houses, he "would set fire to them
without delay."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* His Grace was Charles Spencer, fifth Earl of
Sunderland, who succeeded to the honours of his
illustrious grandfather, John Churchill, the great
captain of Queen Anne's wars.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He also published a manifesto making
known "to all the inhabitants of Brittany,
that the descent on their coast with the
powerful army under our command, and
our formidable armament by sea, was not
made with the intention of making war
on the inhabitants, except such as should
be found in arms, or should otherwise
oppose the just war which we were waging
against His Majesty the most Christian
King.
</p>

<p>
"Be it known, therefore," continues
the manifesto, "to all who will remain in
peaceable possession of their habitations
and effects, that they may stay in their
respective dwellings, and follow their
usual occupations; and that, excepting
the customs and taxes which they pay to
the King, nothing will be required of
them in money or merchandise but what
is absolutely necessary for the subsistence
of the army, and that for all the provisions
they bring in ready money shall be
paid, &amp;c.  Given from our headquarters
at Paramé, June 7."
</p>

<p>
While the British general threatened
destruction unless the peasantry
returned, the French authorities, on the
other hand, threatened to hang all who
obeyed, so between them the poor
Bretons were likely to have a fine time
of it.
</p>

<p>
Our troop was now ordered to
accompany a regiment of foot which was
detached to Dol, a long march by steep
old roads that went straight up one hill
and down another.
</p>

<p>
The day which succeeded that night
of destruction at St. Servand and
St. Solidore was beautiful.  The sun of June
was warm and glowing, and brightly it
shone on the bluff rocks and embattled
walls of St. Malo, on the masses of
charred wreck that floated by the isle of
Aaron; on the dense old forests in the
foreground, the blue hills whose wavy
outline towered in the distance, and on
the blue sea that stretched away towards
the shores of England; on the quaint old
chateaux of the noblesse perched on rocks
that overhung the mountain torrents, and
on the picturesque hovels of their vassals
that nestled under their protection, for
vassalage yet lingered in primitive
Brittany.
</p>

<p>
These poor cottages, built of rough and
unhewn stone, and plastered with mud,
we generally found to be abandoned by
the inhabitants at our approach.  In some
places we passed stacks of slowly-burning
wood smouldering by the wayside; but
the poor charcoal-burners had lied when
our drums woke the echoes of the
mountain road.
</p>

<p>
"It is certainly not pleasant to find
oneself in the character of an invader!"
said Charters, as we rode leisurely on.
</p>

<p>
When we proceeded further, we found
the farms abandoned, the villas deserted
and stripped of all that was most
valuable.  Goats no longer grazed on the
heathy mountain slopes, or cattle in the
verdant meadows; all had been driven
off to forest recesses, to conceal them from
us; yet never was there less mischief
done to private property by an invading
force than by us on this occasion.
</p>

<p>
During a halt near an ancient church,
Jack Charters, observing the earth at the
root of a tree to have been recently
disturbed, thrust his sword into it, and about
eighteen inches below the surface found all
the sacred vessels of the altar, tied up in a
tablecloth.  There were three elaborately
chased gold chalices, a patine, and several
silver salvers and cruets.  Our troops
were making merry on the discovery of
this plunder, when Charters, who never
forgot his forfeited position, and felt
himself still a gentleman, restored the
whole to the curé of the church, who came
to beg it of us.
</p>

<p>
Soon after, an officer of one of our foot
regiments found near a chateau a quantity
of silver plate, worth several hundred
pounds, concealed in the same manner.
This officer sent the plate to the chateau,
from which the proprietor was absent
(for indeed he was no other than Captain
the Chevalier de Boisguiller, who was
making himself so active against us),
together with a letter, purporting that he
had restored the treasure, as we came not
to war on the people, but the government
of France.  In proof of this, in
many instances our men shared their
scanty rations with the poor and needy
whom they found by the wayside, and
who trusted us.
</p>

<p>
Rumour of such acts as these having
preceded us, we were kindly, even warmly
received by the people of Dol, which is an
ancient episcopal city surrounded by time-worn
fortifications, and situated in the midst
of what was then a marshy plain.  Its
mediæval streets are quaint and narrow,
with picturesque gables and carved
gablets that almost meet from either side
of the way.
</p>

<p>
We entered it without opposition, after
a fourteen miles' march, and to our
surprise the bells of the cathedral rung a
merry peal in our honour.  A contribution
was levied on the city exchequer,
and there we passed the night after posting
guards at all the gates and outpickets
beyond.  The duty apportioned to the
light troop of the Scots Greys was
solely to furnish patrols on the various
roads leading to Dol, to prevent a
surprise, for as yet we knew not exactly what
troops were in Brittany.
</p>

<p>
About daybreak on the following
morning, I formed one of a party that
patrolled the highway in the direction of
St. Aubin du Cormier.  Cornet Keith
commanded, and Sergeant Duff and Corporal
Charters were with us.  Each officer
and man carried oats for his horse in a
bag, and a bundle of hay trussed up in a
net behind the saddle.  We were only
eleven in all.
</p>

<p>
Keith was a brave but inexperienced
young officer, who had joined our corps
from Richmond's Foot in consequence of
an incident which made some noise in the
service at the time.
</p>

<p>
Richmond's regiment enjoyed the
unfortunate reputation of bring a duelling
one.  Indeed, there was scarcely an officer
in it who had not, at some time or other,
paraded, and killed or wounded his man;
thus Keith, soon after joining it as a raw
ensign, was informed by the captain of
the Grenadiers, "a fire-eater," that another
officer had treated him in a manner
deserving severe notice, and that "after
<i>what</i> had taken place"&mdash;the usual dubious,
but constant phrase on such occasions&mdash;he
of the Grenadiers would gladly act as
his friend; <i>but</i> that if Keith omitted to
parade the insulter duly by daybreak on
the morrow, it would be noticed by the
whole corps, and hopeless "Coventry"
would be the result.
</p>

<p>
Keith was unable to perceive that he
had been in the least insulted; but knew
in a moment that his would-be friend had
no other object in view than to test his
courage and arrange a duel, a little luxury
the corps had not enjoyed for two months
past.  He perceived also, that to maintain
his own reputation, the fatal pistol <i>must</i>
be resorted to; but as he had no intention
of fighting an innocent man who had
never offended him, he threw his leather
glove in the face of the Grenadier, called
him out, and shot him through the lungs
as a lesson for the future, and soon after
obtained a transfer to the Greys, when we
were cantoned among the villages of the
Sussex Coast, hunting for smugglers.
</p>

<p>
We were riding leisurely in file, through
a narrow lane, about two miles from Dol.
It was bordered by wild vines, and shaded
by chestnut trees.  The grey daylight
was just breaking; the pale mist was
rolling in masses along the mountain
slopes, and the sweet odour of the bay
myrtle and of the wild flowers came on
the morning breeze from the marshes that
lay between us and the city.
</p>

<p>
Save the tinkling of some chapel bell
for matins among the mountains all was
still, and we heard only the hoofs of our
horses and the clatter of their chain
bridles; but judge of our astonishment when
wheeling out of the narrow lane upon the
highway that led direct to Dol&mdash;the path
by which we could alone return&mdash;we found
in our front a party of French Light
Horse, forty at least of the same Hussars
we had encountered in the night near
St. Solidore; and the moment we came in
sight they began to brandish their sabres,
and to whoop and yell in that manner
peculiar to the French before engaging,
while many shouted loudly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vive le Roi! à bas les Anglais!</i>"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap02"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
A SKIRMISH.
</h3>

<p>
Our young Cornet Keith never for an
instant lost his presence of mind, for he
came of a brave stock, the old Keiths of
Inverugie; thus he was a near kinsman
of Marshal Keith, who fell at the head
of the Prussian army on the plain of
Hochkirchen.
</p>

<p>
"We must charge and break through
those fellows," said he, coolly and rapidly,
"or we shall all be taken and cut to
pieces."
</p>

<p>
"I fear, sir, it is impossible to
break through," said Sergeant Duff, as he
cocked his holster pistol.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of this kind is impossible to
the Scots Greys!" replied the young officer,
proudly.
</p>

<p>
"Lead on, sir; and we shall never
flinch," said Charters, with a flushing
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Keep your horses well in hand, my
lads," cried Keith.  "We may not <i>all</i>
be killed&mdash;so prepare to charge! spur at
them&mdash;fire your pistols right into their
teeth, and then fall on with the
sword.  Forward&mdash;charge&mdash;hurrah and
strike home!"
</p>

<p>
We received a confused discharge of
pistols from those French Hussars.  One
of our horses fell and crushed his hapless
rider.  In the next moment we were
right among them&mdash;firing our pistols by
the bridle hand, and hewing right and
left, or fiercely giving point to the front,
with our long straight broadswords,
beneath the weight of which their short
crooked sabres were as children's toys.
Here Big Hob Elliot cut a Hussar's
sword arm clean off, by a single stroke,
above the elbow.
</p>

<p>
Still they were too many for us.  There
was a brief and most unequal hand to
hand conflict amid the smoke of our
pistols, and red sparks sprang high as the
steel blades met and rung.  Cornet Keith
clove one Hussar to the eyes, ran a second
through the breast, and being well
mounted on a magnificent grey horse,
broke through the press of men and
chargers, and effected a retreat or
flight&mdash;which you will&mdash;to Dol.
</p>

<p>
Six others, of whom Jack Charters and
Hob Elliot were two&mdash;succeeded in
following him; but three perished under the
reiterated blows of more than twenty
sabres, while I, separated from the rest,
had my horse thrust half into a beech
hedge by the pressure and numbers of the
enemy, whose leader, a brilliantly attired
hussar officer, with a white scarf across
his shoulder, and golden grand cross of
St. Louis dangling from its crimson ribbon
at his breast, attacked me with great
vigour.
</p>

<p>
Finding that I was quite his equal with
the sword, he drew a pistol from his
saddle-bow and fired it straight at my head.  By
a smart use of the spurs and bit, I made
my horse rear up; thus the bullet entered
his neck and saved me.  Then in its agony
the poor animal made a wild plunge, and
bursting through the mob of hussars who
pressed about me, rushed along the road
with such speed that I was soon safe, even
from their carbines, and found myself alone
and free, without a scratch or scar.
</p>

<p>
On, on flew the maddened horse, I knew
not whither.  There was a gurgling sound
in his throat, and with every bound the
red blood welled up and poured from the
bullet-wound over his grey skin, which
was drenched with the flowing torrent.
</p>

<p>
I lost my grenadier cap as he flew on,
past cottages of mud and thatch, and
chateaux with turrets, vanes, and moats;
past wayside wells and votive crosses, and
past those tall grey monoliths and
cromlechs that stud so thickly all the land of
Brittany; past fields of yellowing
buckwheat and thickets of pale green vines,
till, at a sudden turn of the road, near an
ancient and ruinous bridge that spanned
a deep and brawling torrent, he sank
suddenly beneath me, and fell heavily on the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Disengaging myself from the saddle and
stirrups, I proceeded to examine the horse's
wound.  His large eyes, once so bright,
were covered now with film, and his long
red tongue was lolling out upon the dusty
road.  My gallant grey was in his death
agony, and thrice drew his sinewy legs up
under his belly and thrust them forth with
convulsive energy.  At the third spasm,
when I was stooping to examine the wound,
his off fore hoof struck me like a shot on
the right temple, inflicting a most severe
and stunning wound, and I sank senseless
and bleeding beside him.
</p>

<p>
Half-an-hour probably elapsed before
perfect consciousness returned.  Then I
found my face so plastered by the blood
which had flowed from my wound, that
my eyes were almost sealed up by it, and
my hair, which was curled (as we wore it
so, and <i>not</i> queued, like the troops of
other corps), was thickly clotted also.
</p>

<p>
In the mêlée, or race, I cannot remember
which, I had lost my sword and pistols,
so concealment was my first thought; my
second, anxiety to reach Dol or the camp
at Paramé.  How either was to be achieved
in a country where my red uniform marked
me as a mortal foe and invader, to be shot
down&mdash;destroyed by any man, or by any
means&mdash;was a point not easy to solve.
Moreover, I knew not the language of
Brittany, in only some districts of which
French is spoken.
</p>

<p>
I left my dead grey&mdash;poor Bob, for so
he was named&mdash;with a bitter sigh; for
daily, since I became a soldier, had the
noble horse fed from my hand, and he
knew my voice as well as the trumpet call
for "corn" or "water."
</p>

<p>
I walked along the road unsteadily,
giddy, faint, and ill.  After proceeding
about a quarter of a mile, I came upon a
four-wheeled wain laden with straw, and
standing neglected, apparently, by the
wayside.  No horses were harnessed to it,
and no driver or other person was near.
It seemed to offer, until nightfall, a
comfortable place of concealment.  I clambered
up, and, nestling down among the straw,
tied my handkerchief round my contused
head to stop further bleeding, and in a few
minutes after, overcome by the sleepless
patrolling of the past night, the excitement
and peril of the recent conflict, the
long and mad race run by my dying horse&mdash;a
race perhaps of twenty or thirty miles,
for I knew not the distance&mdash;the pain of
the wound his hoof had given me, and the
consequent loss of blood, I fell into a deep
and dreamless stupor, for I cannot call it
sleep.
</p>

<p>
While I was in this state, it would seem
that the proprietor of the wain had come
hither, yoked thereto a pair of horses, and,
all unconscious that there was anything
else there than straw, forage for the cavalry
of the most Christian King&mdash;least of all
a "sacré-Anglais"&mdash;in the wain, drove
leisurely and quietly off, I knew not
whither, as I neither stirred nor woke.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
HUSSARS AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
Evening had come on before I was awake,
and, on looking upward, saw above me the
green leafy branches of some great trees.
Then, on peeping from my nest amid the
straw, I found, to my very great astonishment,
that the wain was not in the same
place where I had entered it, but that it
was now at the end of a long and stately
avenue, and close to an embattled wall, in
which there opened an arched gateway
surmounted by a coat of arms carved in
stone.
</p>

<p>
I was about to investigate this circumstance
further, when the sound of voices
near me, or apparently immediately under
the huge wain, made me shrink down and
lie still and breathless to listen.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, <i>mon ami</i>, don't lose your
temper, for I assure you that you have
none to spare," said a female voice.
</p>

<p>
"Bah! you always laugh when I kiss
you, Angelique," replied a man,
reproachfully; "why is this?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, Jacquot, your moustaches
tickle me."
</p>

<p>
"You are always rather too ticklish
between the nose and chin," retorted the
other.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so, when Monsieur de Boisguiller
and his hussars are here."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu</i>, if this be the case, then I
shall go back to St. Malo, to dine with the
fat cits and dance with their pretty
daughters."
</p>

<p>
"You?  Ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Laugh as you may, mademoiselle: the
coachman of Monsieur le Curé of St. Solidore,
who holds the consciences of half
the province in his keeping, is not without
some importance at St. Malo, be assured."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Que cons êtes bon!</i> (what a simpleton
you are!) Kiss me and say nothing more."
</p>

<p>
A certain remarkable sound followed;
then the lovers, apparently reconciled,
passed through the archway, and I could
perceive that the man was no other than
Jacquot Tricot, who had driven the
<i>d'esobligeant</i> of the old Curé of St. Solidore,
and that his companion was a pretty and
piquant young Bretonne, with fine features
and coal-black eyes, and having her dark
hair dressed back <i>à la marquise</i>, under a
tall white cap of spotless linen.
</p>

<p>
She wore a tight red bodice, with its
armholes so large that at the back only
an inch or two of the stuff remained
between the shoulders; but under this she
had a pretty habit-shirt, which fully
displayed the swelling form of her fine bust
and shoulders.  Her ample but short black
skirt, embroidered with silver, announced,
after the Breton custom, that she was not
altogether dowerless, and by her high
instep, smart ankle, and taper leg, no one
could doubt that Angelique was a charming
dancer.
</p>

<p>
I am thus particular in describing this
girl, who was a piquante little country
beauty, full of queer Breton exclamations,
because our acquaintance did not end here.
</p>

<p>
My wound was very painful.  I felt
weak and light-headed; but the consciousness
that other concealment was necessary
made me look about for a new lurking-place.
</p>

<p>
On one side of the avenue there opened
a spacious lawn; on the other lay a lake,
and above the embattled wall and gateway
the turrets of a chateau were visible in
the sunshine.  In the middle of the lawn
grew a thicket of shrubs or dwarf trees.
My course was soon determined on&mdash;to
reach the thicket and remain there concealed
till nightfall, and trust the rest to
Providence.
</p>

<p>
I dropped from the summit of the straw-laden
wain, and, passing quickly through
the line of lofty trees, was about to hurry
across the lawn, when I heard a shout
uttered by many voices, and found myself
within fifty paces of a strong party of
French Hussars, who had picketed their
horses near the avenue, and were quietly
enjoying, <i>al fresco</i>, a meal which had no
doubt been sent to them from the chateau.
It was quite a military picnic, as they
were all lounging on the grass, around
cold pies, fowls, tarts, and bottles of wine,
with their jackets open, their belts and
pelisses off.
</p>

<p>
So busy had they been with their jaws,
that their tongues had been silent hitherto,
and thus I knew nothing of a vicinity so
dangerous, until it was too late to retreat.
</p>

<p>
Being defenceless, my first thought was
to advance confidently and surrender
myself as a prisoner of war; but, on
seeing that while some rushed to their
holsters to procure pistols, others snatched
up their sabres, with cries of&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Down with the Englishman!  <i>Sacré Dieu!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Shoot him down!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>A bas les Anglais!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Tuez</i>!  <i>Tuez</i>!  Cut him to pieces!" and
so forth, I turned and fled towards the
chateau, followed by the whole party,
some twenty in number, on foot.
</p>

<p>
Several shots were fired, but I escaped
them all.  I passed the wain, dashed
through the gateway within which
Angelique and Jacquot were still tenderly
cooing and billing, and crossed the
gravelled courtyard, closely pursued by
the hussars, who would no doubt have
immolated me there, had not a young lady
who was standing on the steps of the
entrance-door in conversation with a
brilliant-looking cavalry officer, rushed
forward and courageously and humanely
interposed between them and me, with her
arms outspread.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu!</i> where did you come from,
<i>Coquin</i>?  Cut the fellow down!"
exclaimed the officer, who was the Chevalier
Guillaume do Boisguiller, and in whom I
recognised my antagonist of the morning&mdash;he
of the white scarf, crimson ribbon,
and grand cross of St. Louis.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ah, je vous prie</i>, monsieur le
Chevalier&mdash;Messieurs les soldats, don't harm him,
pray," cried the young lady; and then she
added&mdash;"Nay, hold, I command you!"
</p>

<p>
"What! you intercede for him, do you?"
said the officer, with haughty surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I do, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"Although he is one of those pestilent
English who have been playing the devil
at Cancalle and St. Malo?"
</p>

<p>
"I care not&mdash;I am Jacqueline de Broglie."
</p>

<p>
It was she indeed&mdash;she whom I had
rescued, and who gave me the emerald
ring by the wayside well; but she was
now so richly attired, and had her fine
hair so perfectly dressed, that I did not
at first, and in such a terrible crisis,
recognise her.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu</i>, 'tis very well.  Fall back,
comrades, sheath your sabres, and finish
your luncheon, for we march at sunset,"
said the captain, twisting his short
moustache; "but what am I to
understand by all this, mademoiselle?"
</p>

<p>
"That he saved my life&mdash;my honour&mdash;scarcely
four-and-twenty hours ago," said
she, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sacré!</i> he nearly took both my life
and honour this morning," said the
chevalier, with a grimace.
</p>

<p>
"And he is wounded&mdash;severely, too&mdash;the
poor fellow!" she added, in a voice
of tender commiseration.
</p>

<p>
"What! is this the soldier of whom
you were just speaking&mdash;he who saved
you from that rascal Hautois, on the
night St. Solidore was cannonaded
and destroyed?" asked the hussar, with
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"The same, Monsieur de Boisguiller,
and I demand that here, on my own
threshold, his life shall be respected."
</p>

<p>
"So be it, mademoiselle; for your sake,
I would spare the lives of the whole
British army, if such were your wish&mdash;assuredly
it should not be <i>mine</i>," said the
captain, bowing low, with a tender glance
in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"I thank you, M. le Chevalier," replied
the lady, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"And I congratulate you, M. le soldat,
on having such an intercessor," said the
Frenchman, making a merit of necessity,
and with somewhat of apparent frankness
presenting his hand to me.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the whole place, the
chateau with its turrets, the chevalier
and the lady, appeared to whirl round me;
the light went from my eyes, and darkness
seemed to descend in its place; I
made a wild clutch at a railing to prevent
myself from falling, but failed; and,
sinking on the steps that led to the
entrance, remember no more of that interview.
</p>

<p>
For several days after this, all was
confusion or all oblivion to me.
</p>

<p>
I was delirious and in a burning fever.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
MY NURSE.
</h3>

<p>
Where was I?
</p>

<p>
My next recollection, as the world
came slowly back to me, or I to it, was
the circumstance of finding myself in
a small octagonal chamber, which was
hung with pretty, but rather gaudy
pictures of saints, in long scarlet or blue
garments; there were St. Peter with his
keys, St. Andrew with his cross,
St. Catherine with her wheel, and St. Malo
with something else.  There were also a
crucifix and little font of Delft ware hung
on the wall near me.
</p>

<p>
I was in a bed that was prettily draped
by snow-white curtains, which hung from
a ring in the ceiling, and formed a
complete bell-tent around me, but were
festooned back on one side.  The soft
pillows were edged with narrow lace.
</p>

<p>
The sun of the summer noon shone
through the vine and ivy shaded lattice,
which was open, and the hum of the
honey bee, with the sweet perfume of
summer flowers, came in together on the
soft and ambient air.
</p>

<p>
Close at hand stood a <i>guéridon</i>, as the
French name those little round tables
which have three feet and one stem; and
thereon were some phials, a vase of
flowers, and a silver cup, which suggested
to me, somehow, an idea of medicine.
</p>

<p>
I passed a hand across my brow; it
was painful to the touch, and throbbed.
My eyes were hot and heavy; my hand
looked pale, thin, and white&mdash;quite unlike
what it usually was; hence I must have
been long ill&mdash;but <i>where</i>?
</p>

<p>
I strove to rise, that I might look
forth from the window; but the effort
was too much for me yet, and I sank back
on my pillow.
</p>

<p>
I seemed to have had strange dreams
of late&mdash;dreams of my brief soldiering;
of the burning of the shipping; the faces
and voices of Charters, Kirkton, and
others had come distinctly&mdash;especially
poor Tom's (the "stick it minister," as the
Greys named him), and the words of his
song lingered in my ear:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why, soldiers, why,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we be melancholy, boys,<br />
  Whose business 'tis to die?<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I had strange recollections of a warlike
encounter with old Nathan Wylie in a
wood in Brittany, and shooting him
there, to save my cousin Aurora, whom he
was tying to a tree.  Then my wound
from the charger's hoof, and the events
subsequent thereto, gradually and
coherently unfolded themselves before me.
But where was I, and to whom indebted?
</p>

<p>
Some one moved near me; I was certain
there was the fall of a gentle foot&mdash;of
one who stepped on tiptoe.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" I asked in English,
and then repeated the question in French.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you are awake&mdash;awake at last!"
said a soft voice, in the latter tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Who speaks?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>C'est moi</i>&mdash;'tis only me," replied a
girl whose face was familiar to me, as she
drew back the curtain.
</p>

<p>
"Angelique?" said I, with an effort.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Angelique; how droll&mdash;you
know my name, monsieur!"
</p>

<p>
It was the pretty Bretonne, with her
scanty bodice and spotlessly white
shirt; her black eyes beaming with
kindness and pleasure; her dark hair
surmounted by her high linen coif of a
fashion old as the days of Charles VIII.
</p>

<p>
"You know me&mdash;you are sensible at
last," she continued; "ah, how happy
mademoiselle will be to hear of this?"
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, good heavens&mdash;is it possible&mdash;don't
you know&mdash;Mademoiselle de Broglie,
your protectress?"
</p>

<p>
"And you?"
</p>

<p>
"I have the honour to be her <i>soubrette</i>&mdash;her
friend almost, for we are foster
children.  Every morning and every night
I made a sign of the cross on your
forehead with the holy water from my font,
and I knew that it would cure you, even
if everything else failed."
</p>

<p>
"Cure me&mdash;I have, then, been ill?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>O! mon Dieu</i>&mdash;so ill!" shrugging
her white shoulders and clasping her
little hands.
</p>

<p>
"But say, Mademoiselle Angelique,
pray where am I?"
</p>

<p>
"In my room."
</p>

<p>
"Yours?"
</p>

<p>
"Oui, monsieur&mdash;there is nothing
wonderful in that, is there?"
</p>

<p>
"And this bed?"
</p>

<p>
"It is <i>mine</i>," said she, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"You quite bewilder me," said I, with
a sigh.
</p>

<p>
Her dark eyes and white teeth shone, as
she burst into a fit of laughter, and said:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ah, mon Dieu</i>, what would Jacquot&mdash;the
jealous Jacquot&mdash;think, if he knew
that a strange man had occupied my bed
for two weeks?"
</p>

<p>
"Have I been here so long?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, monsieur&mdash;you have been very ill."
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have been occupying the apartments
of Mademoiselle de Broglie; ah, good
heaven, what were you thinking of?"
said the <i>soubrette</i>, with another merry
laugh.  "You occupy my room in the
Chateau of Bourgneuf, belonging to the
Countess Ninon, mother of the young
count, who now is fighting under
Maréchal de Broglie in Germany."
</p>

<p>
"Would Boisguiller's Hussars really
have killed me, alone and defenceless as I
was?"
</p>

<p>
"Killed you, my poor child? of course
they would."
</p>

<p>
"Are they still here?" I asked, with
natural anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma foi!</i> no&mdash;they have long since
been gone in pursuit of the English, who
are flying in all directions towards the sea.
These Hussars are very ferocious.  Some
of them are contributions from the <i>Fours</i>
of Paris, and valuable contributions to the
army <i>they</i> are, as every one knows."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Fours</i>&mdash;I know not what you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I assure you," said I, laying my
hand by chance upon hers.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma foi!</i> it is quite true what Père
Celestine says&mdash;nothing is taught in
England but heresy.  The <i>Fours</i> in Paris
are places of confinement, formed by a
Monsieur d'Argenson, wherein all
wanderers and vagabonds found in the streets
are shut up, till the best are drafted off to
the army, and several of these choice
recruits fell to the lot of M. de Boisguiller.
So you had an escape, my poor boy; they
would positively have eaten you!"
</p>

<p>
"You are very patronising, Angelique,"
said I, amused by the girl's manner;
"pardon me, but how old are you?"
</p>

<p>
"One year older than my mistress."
</p>

<p>
"And she will be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nineteen by the next least of St. Malo;
but hush, you must not talk any more.
You are looking quite flushed already;
now taste this."
</p>

<p>
In perfect innocence she put her plump
white arm round my neck, raised my
head upon her pretty shoulder, took the
silver cup from the <i>guéridon</i>, and poured
between my lips some of the cooling liquid
it contained.
</p>

<p>
"You are kind to me as a sister," said I.
</p>

<p>
"And I have nursed you so long, that
I quite feel like one."
</p>

<p>
Her large dark eyes looked kindly into
mine, and I could see my face reflected in
them.
</p>

<p>
"So long?" I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; fourteen days and fourteen nights."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, how can I ever repay all this?"
</p>

<p>
"By trying to sleep, and sleep you
must," said she; then laying my head
gently on the pillow, she withdrew her
arm, and closing my eyelids playfully
with her fingers, said again in my ear,
"Sleep;" and adding, "Père Celestine
tells us that St. Paul said 'all kisses were
not holy,' but there can be no harm in
<i>these</i>."  And touching each eyelid with her
cherry lip, she patted me on the cheek and
glided away.
</p>

<p>
But the tumult of thought banished
sleep, and indeed she left me very much
awake.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap05"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
NEWS OF THE ARMY.
</h3>

<p>
For two days that succeeded, the
kindness and attention of my little French
nurse were undiminished, and on the third
a soft dressing-gown was brought to me,
and I found myself seated in an easy-chair
at the open window, with a view of
the distant hills, and in a fair way to
convalescence.
</p>

<p>
Was the pretty <i>soubrette</i> in love with
me, or was her peculiar manner merely
the impulsive nature of the Breton,
together with genuine pity for a helpless
fellow-creature&mdash;a poor young soldier&mdash;whom
she had nursed?  Of course it was,
for otherwise she would not have spoken
so frankly or so frequently of her lover,
Jacquot Tricot.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the favours then
heaped on me by fortune, such is the
perversity of human nature, that instead
of being grateful for them, at times, as I
lay there, helpless, wounded, weary and
alone, thinking of the past, of what I was,
and what I should have been, something
of the sullenness of despair stole into my
heart, and I actually longed for death to
rid me of all further trouble, or care for
the future.  But to die there unknown,
and so far, far away from the sequestered
churchyard, where in a pastoral glen upon
the Scottish Border, my father and mother
lay side by side, with the green mounds
that covered them within sound of the
silver Tweed, was not the end I had so
long anticipated.
</p>

<p>
Though a soldier, I was but a boy;
and amid my loneliness in that foreign
land, I wept for the mother of whom I
had known so little, and hoped that from
her place in heaven she was watching
over me, and perhaps could see me there.
</p>

<p>
Thought, reflection, and memory more
frequently rendered me fierce than sad, and
then I closed my eyes, as if to shut out
the light and the world itself.
</p>

<p>
During one of these dreamy paroxysms
of bitterness, a soft hand was laid gently
on my flushed forehead.  I looked up,
and saw a lady&mdash;a lovely young girl&mdash;with
the soubrette beside me.
</p>

<p>
She was Jacqueline de Broglie!  I
strove to rise and make some due
obeisance, but by an unmistakeable gesture
she excused or rather restrained me.
</p>

<p>
When I had first seen this
noble-looking girl, her hair was dishevelled, her
dress was torn and disordered, her face
was pale and distorted by fear, and her
eyes red and swollen by weeping.  Now
I beheld her perfectly calm, self-possessed,
and richly-apparelled, for her dress was
of orange-coloured satin trimmed with
black Maltese lace, and it well became the
purity of her complexion and the intense
darkness of her eyes and hair, every tress
of which bore evidence of the skilful
hands of Angelique.  At first I thought
her stately in bearing and very pretty in
feature, but as we conversed, she rapidly
became beautiful, and dangerously so, as
her expressive face lit up with animation.
</p>

<p>
Her smile was lovely, winning, and
childlike; it was the true gift of nature,
but there was a singular combination of
boldness and extreme delicacy in the
contour of her features.  Her forehead was
broad rather than high; the curve of her
nostril was noble; her mouth and chin
full of sweetness and decision.  Add to
these, a wonderful mass of rich dark hair,
in all the luxuriance of girlhood, and you
see Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
She drew in a chair and seated herself
near me, while Angelique stood behind.
She expressed her satisfaction to find that
I was recovering, but added that the
observance of the greatest secrecy was
necessary; that to save me from the
rough peasantry, who were infuriated by
our wanton irruption into Brittany, she
had kept me concealed in a wing of the
chateau&mdash;a portion appropriated by
herself and Angelique.  She mentioned that
to deceive alike the servants of the family,
the neighbouring peasantry, and the
Hussars of the Chevalier de Boisguiller,
it had been given out that I was
conveyed away in M. le Curé's <i>désobligeant</i> to
Dol; while in fact, by the exertions of
the curé and Angelique, I had been
supported to my present room when in a
state of insensibility, and had remained
there in secrecy to the great risk of my
own life, and of the honour of my
protectresses if discovered.  This was the plain
and unvarnished story, though Jacqueline
worded it in a more delicate and gentle
manner.
</p>

<p>
"I am most grateful to you, mademoiselle,"
said I, "for your kindness,
your charity to me."
</p>

<p>
"Kindness&mdash;charity!  Why such cold
words?  <i>Mon Dieu!</i> monsieur, do not talk
thus.  Could I do less than, at every
hazard to save and protect one who saved
and protected me?" she exclaimed,
bending her dark and beautiful eyes on mine
with an expression of half-reproach and
inquiry which made my heart throb almost
painfully, for I was still weak and faint.
</p>

<p>
"And I have trespassed, intruded on
your hospitality for so many days.  In
that time what may have been the fortune
of war with my comrades?  And madame
your aunt; did she escape that night at
St. Solidore?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; fortunately she reached St. Malo
by a boat, and has not yet returned; so
at present I am lady supreme
here&mdash;chatelaine of Bourgneuf."
</p>

<p>
"I have been ill&mdash;very ill, and must
have lost much blood," said I, as the room
seemed to whirl round me; "who has
been my doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Angelique, with my assistance.  There
are no doctors nearer than Rennes, the
nuns of St. Gildas excepted, and they could
not be taken into our confidence, though
good Père Celestine was.  So what was
to be done, but to seclude you here at the
top of the house and trust to Heaven and
your youth for recovery."
</p>

<p>
"Dear Mademoiselle de Broglie, all this
was more than I had any reason to expect of
you&mdash;more than human kindness!  Had
I died here, what would you have done?"
</p>

<p>
"Prayed for you," was the reply; "but
ah, don't speak of such a thing!"
</p>

<p>
"How the child talks!" said Angelique;
"Monsieur de Boisguiller's Hussars are
playful lambs when compared to our
Breton peasants&mdash;our woodcutters and
charcoal-burners.  They would have torn
you limb from limb had they caught you.
<i>Ma foi!</i> yes&mdash;and they would storm the
chateau, perhaps, if they knew you were
in it, as one would crack a nutshell to
get at the kernel."
</p>

<p>
"How far are we from the hills of Paramé?"
</p>

<p>
"About fifteen leagues," replied Mademoiselle
de Broglie; "but why do you ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Because our camp was there, mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
"My poor friend, you are not aware of
what has taken place since fortune cast
you almost dying at our door."
</p>

<p>
"A battle has been fought!"
</p>

<p>
"No; for the Duke of Marlborough,
who lacks the skill of his great namesake, on
hearing that certain forces were marching
against him, under Monseigneur le Duc
d'Aiguillon, Governor of Brittany,
withdrew his troops from Dol and Paramé, and
retreating with all speed to the bay of
Cancalle, embarked his whole forces there
on the 12th of this month, and sailed for
England."
</p>

<p>
"Are all gone?" I inquired, with
irrepressible agitation.
</p>

<p>
"All&mdash;save the dead and you."
</p>

<p>
"And I am left here!" I exclaimed,
overcome with consternation.
</p>

<p>
"With <i>us</i>," replied the lady with a
pouting smile.
</p>

<p>
"True, mademoiselle; my exclamation
is alike ungrateful and ungallant; what
matter is one poor trooper more or less."
</p>

<p>
"However, monsieur may soon see his
friends again," continued Mademoiselle
de Broglie, "for they still menace our poor
province of Brittany.  So stormy has
been the weather, that it was not until the
21st of this month the fleet got clear of the
coast of France.  On the 25th it was
visible off Hâvre de Grace, which
M. Marlborough bravely enough reconnoitred
in an open cutter; but Heaven favoured
us with another tempest, and the British
were blown out to sea.  On the 27th&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday!"
</p>

<p>
"Only yesterday, as the Chevalier de
Boisguiller informed me this morning, they
came to anchor within two miles of
Cherbourg, and hoisted out some flat-bottomed
boats with the English guards to attack
the forts of Querqueville and L'Hommet;
but again kind Heaven&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"With St. Malo and St. Suliac,"
interposed the <i>soubrette</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Sent a storm, so the attempt was
abandoned, and Monsieur Howe stood off
to sea, where many of his transports were
dashed to pieces."
</p>

<p>
"Many must have perished, and among
them may be some of my dear friends!"
said I, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"I hope not, monsieur.  But your
people should not have landed in Brittany,
which has ever been the best bulwark of
France&mdash;'La Bretagne, Brettonnante,' as
we say.  When the wild Norseman menaced
our shores, in the days of King Dagobert,
it was here they met with the most
bloody resistance.  Here Bertrand de
Gruesclin routed the English in the days
of Charles VI., and here, too, were they
defeated in the days of Charles VII. by
Arthur Count of Richemont, who was
Constable of France and Duke of Bretagne;
while in the last century your fleets were
swept from our shores by those of Du
Guay Trouin.  So excuse me saying,
<i>mon ami</i>, that you were most unwise
to attack our old Celtic province of
Brittany."
</p>

<p>
I could scarcely conceal a smile at this
little bit of gasconade, when I
remembered how much mischief we had done to
government property, the ships and stores
we had destroyed, unopposed by any armed
force save a few hussars; but the loveliness
of the lips that spoke repressed the
rising spirit of retort.
</p>

<p>
"However," she added, smiling, "I am
a Parisienne&mdash;<i>not</i> a Bretonne."
</p>

<p>
"And why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What, monsieur le soldat?"
</p>

<p>
"Why banished to this wild province?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not banished, as you unpleasantly
term it," said she, colouring; "but
while my father is at the head of an army
in Germany, he prefers that I should
reside here, with my aunt, Madame de
Bourgneuf.  But we have talked too long,
and I must have wearied you."
</p>

<p>
"You, mademoiselle!" I was beginning,
when she rose and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Another day I will visit you, so, for
the present, adieu."
</p>

<p>
I was no longer the bashful boy who
had so timidly confessed his love to little
Ruth Wylie.  A few months of soldiering
had rubbed the rust completely off me.
Thus, when this French girl, with all her
imposing presence, her long train, and
her hair <i>à la marquise</i>, presented her hand
to me, I pressed it to my lips with an air
so tender and withal so perfectly
confident, that she withdrew it rather hastily
and retired.
</p>

<p>
I was again alone.
</p>

<p>
Strange and mysterious was the power
that lurked in those lovely eyes&mdash;in the
slow droop of the fringed lids, and their
upward sweep when they flashed in smiles
upon me.
</p>

<p>
I lay back in my easy-chair and closed
my eyes, but they still seemed to see the
face and form of Jacqueline de Broglie.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
BOURGNEUF.
</h3>

<p>
The chateau of Bourgneuf, within which
I so singularly found myself an inhabitant,
stands* on the north slope of a hill, about
a mile from the old highway that leads
from Dol to Rennes, the capital of
Brittany, where <i>bourg</i> signifies especially
a village or residence.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* We may now say <i>stood</i>, as it was demolished
in the wars subsequent to the Revolution.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was a fabric of striking aspect, but
of large and irregular proportions, having
been built in the days of local war and
turbulence, when the lords of Bourgneuf
kept constantly a numerous body of
armed men about them.  As the household
consisted now only of the widowed
countess (then at St. Malo), her niece,
Mademoiselle de Broglie, and a few
servants, for the young count was serving
with his regiment, but a small portion of
this great mansion was inhabited, and
thus a melancholy stillness reigned in its
long, shady galleries, great suites of
apartments, and round towers, the bases
of which were washed by the waters of a
lake.
</p>

<p>
It had at least twenty steep conical
roofs on its towers and turrets, and each
of these was surmounted by a grotesque
iron girouette, as the French name those
vanes which were exclusively placed on
the houses of their ancient nobility.
</p>

<p>
In this chateau had Isabelle of Scotland,
daughter of James I., passed two nights
when proceeding to Rennes, where, in
1442, she was married to Francis I.,
Duke of Bretagne; where the peasants yet
sing of her beauty, and the luxuriance of
her golden hair.
</p>

<p>
The edifice resembled in style several
of our old Scottish baronial dwellings,
such as Glammis or Castle Huntly, and I
afterwards learnt that it had been
engrafted on an older fortress of the Counts
of Brittany, in which died Alain with
the Strong Beard, in the tenth century;
and like all ancient castles in France, it
had its legends of blood and sorrow.
</p>

<p>
It was approached from the Rennes
road through two rows of ancient yews,
of vast size, towering, solemn, and sombre.
Between each of these stood an orange-tree
in a green tub; and in the garden
were long walks covered with closely cut
grass, and a labyrinth of trim beech
hedges of great height, amid the dense
leaves of which the lark and yellow-hammer
built their nests undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
I remember the spacious entrance-hall,
with its floor of tesselated marble, its tall
cabinets of ebony and <i>marqueterie</i>, piled
with rare china and Indian pagodas; its
trophies of arms, a barred helmet or
dinted corslet forming the centre of each;
its vast dining-hall, with deeply-recessed
windows, tapestry curtains, and chairs
covered with rose-coloured brocaded silk;
and in that hall, Francis II., last Duke of
Brittany, had been feasted in 1459 by
Roderique, Count of Bourgneuf, who was
slain by a Burgundian knight six years
after at the battle of Montleheri.
</p>

<p>
The long disused moat of the old
mansion was overgrown by wild brambles,
and masses of clematis and ivy shrouded
the cannon, carriages and all, on the
bastion at the outer gate.  Old pieces
they were&mdash;old perhaps as the days of
the League; and above the gate they
had once defended, were carved the three
besants of Bourgneuf, impaled with the
saltire of Broglie.
</p>

<p>
Such was the old chateau in Brittany,
wherein the fortune of war had so
strangely cast me.
</p>

<p>
On the window of my bedroom I one
day discovered the name of the author of
"Gil Blas," Alain René le Sage (who
was a Breton), written with a diamond,
for he had once visited the chateau; this
window overlooked the lake, which was
covered by water-lilies, and bordered by
long reedy grass, where the snipe lay
concealed, and the tall heron waded in
search of the gold-scaled barbel.
</p>

<p>
Beyond this lake rose some steep and
rugged rocks, nearly covered by the yellow
bells of the wild gorse; and on the highest
stood a haunted Druid stone, around which
the fairies and the <i>poulpicous</i> (their
husbands) danced on certain nights.  This
stone, as Angelique assured me, bore a
deep mark, the cut of Excalibur, the sword
of King Arthur, who is peculiarly the
national hero of the Bretons.
</p>

<p>
How was I to get away from this
secluded place?
</p>

<p>
By sea every port and harbour were
watched and guarded.  If discovered, the
jealous military authorities would certainly
put me to death without much inquiry, as
a spy; the peasantry as an invader; the
local magistrates or lords, would be sure
to dispose of me as <i>both</i>.
</p>

<p>
This was a tormenting question which
even my kind little nurse Angelique
could in no way answer.  Indeed, she
detailed so many difficulties to be overcome,
and so many dangers to be dared, that
there seemed a probability of my spending
the term of my natural life at the chateau
of Bourgneuf, unless Commodore Howe
with his fleet, and His Grace of
Marlborough with at least ten thousand men,
paid again a special visit to Brittany, the
chance of which was very slender; and
a conversation, a portion of which I
was compelled to overhear, between
Angelique and her lover Jacquot, served
still more to increase my anxiety to
be gone.
</p>

<p>
He had come to announce the return of
the countess in a few days, after a certain
pilgrimage, in which she was to accompany
Père Celestine and a train of devotees
to the Hole of the Serpent, and see the
silver cross of St. Suliac dipped three
times in the lonely cave of La Guivre, a
famous religious superstition of the
Bretons.
</p>

<p>
What I overheard took place on the
fourth day of my convalescence.
</p>

<p>
"So you are sulky and in a pet, Monsieur
Jacquot?" said the <i>soubrette</i>, pouting,
with her hands in the pockets of her
little apron.
</p>

<p>
"Perchance I have reason to be so,
Mademoiselle Angelique," replied the
other, with his hands thrust into his
breeches pockets.
</p>

<p>
"You think yourself very clever, no
doubt!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu!</i> what if I do?"
</p>

<p>
"I have heard that when at school&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Bah! don't talk of our days at school.
All clever men are dunces there."
</p>

<p>
"A clever boy <i>you</i> must have been!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morbleu!</i>" growled Jacquot; "a lover
does not like to be laughed at."
</p>

<p>
"In such a humour, Monsieur Jacquot,
what in the name of goodness brings you
to me?"
</p>

<p>
"Say rather <i>badness</i>, mademoiselle, and
it may better suit your disposition."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed! are you jealous of anyone
again?  Monsieur de Boisguiller and his
hussars are now gone to Rennes."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but the spark who walks with you
on the north terrace in the twilight&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"<i>O ciel!</i> what are you saying?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and whom I have caught so often
lurking among the shrubbery and in the
avenue at night; he, at least, is <i>not</i> gone
to Rennes.  An ugly fellow he is too, with
a mark like a bullet-hole in each cheek.
Eh, Mademoiselle Angelique, what say
you to this?"
</p>

<p>
I did not hear the girl's reply, and they
moved away from the room adjoining
mine; but I had heard enough to cause
me intense alarm.  I had been twice on
the north terrace in the evening with
Angelique; but <i>who</i> was the lurker detected
by Jacquot in the shrubbery and avenue?
</p>

<p>
"An ugly fellow with a mark like a
bullet-hole in each cheek!"  My heart
foreboded in a moment that he must be
the ruffian Hautois.
</p>

<p>
If he had traced me to the chateau, I
was lost indeed!
</p>

<p>
No sooner was Jacquot gone, than
Angelique came to me, and repeated
all that I had previously heard, adding
that some disguise was necessary now;
but we knew not what kind to adopt.  In
the meantime, my uniform&mdash;my poor red
coat, which I had first donned with such
pride at Rothbury&mdash;was concealed or
destroyed, and she brought me a hunting-suit
of green cloth from the wardrobe of
the absent count.
</p>

<p>
Still complete seclusion was necessary,
and I could only take the air in the evening,
on a secluded terrace or upper bartizan of
the chateau, where Mademoiselle de
Broglie and her attendant frequently sat
in a kind of bower formed by the
projection of a turret and a mass of wild
roses, and where they read, chatted, or
worked.
</p>

<p>
I had the pleasure of spending several
evenings with Mademoiselle de Broglie
there, and with each of these lovely summer
evenings, when the purple shadow of the
chateau fell far across the weedy lake,
whose waters rippled in opal tints, and
when the Druid monolith on the opposite
rocks shone like a pillar of flame in the
crimson light of the setting sun, it seemed
to me that I was becoming less and less
anxious about my escape from Bourgneuf,
my flight from Brittany, and my return
to the army.
</p>

<p>
Why was this?  I asked my heart, and
could only look for an answer in the quiet
deep eyes of Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
Her emerald ring was still on my finger,
and as I looked at it again and again, and
then on the lovely donor, the words of
Charters, when I first showed him the ring
on that morning near our camp at Paramé,
came back to my memory like a prediction
about to be verified.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
LOVE AND ILLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
On one of those evenings when Angelique
was seated on a tabourette, working
with her pretty nimble fingers a piece of
lace, and when Jacqueline had tired of
reading aloud the travels of the Comte de
Caylus, which were then in the zenith of
their fame, and had permitted the volume to
drop listlessly from her hand, we began to
converse on the usual topics, dread of the
countess's sudden return, of her discovering
me, and the means by which to escape
from any Breton seaport to England.
Mistrusting her discretion, it was evident
that the curé of St. Solidore had not
informed her of <i>his</i> share in my concealment,
or of the circumstance at all, so
madam was yet in ignorance.
</p>

<p>
"Were I once clear of your cruisers
from Brest and St. Malo in any boat,
however small, I might reach England,
or be picked up," said I, heedless that the
distance from Portsmouth to Cherbourg
alone was seventy-five miles; "most loth
am I to trespass further on your kindness."
</p>

<p>
"Think of what I owe you, my life!"
said Mademoiselle de Broglie, and as our
hands chanced to touch each other, we
both trembled without knowing why.
</p>

<p>
"I have met with so little kindness in
the world, mademoiselle, that there is no
chance of my stock of gratitude becoming
exhausted.  My birthright is that of the
disinherited&mdash;obscurity, poverty, and
mortification," said I, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  What is this you tell me?"
she exclaimed, turning her fine eyes full
upon me.
</p>

<p>
"My family have made me, as it were,
an Ishmael&mdash;an outcast from amid them;
but they shall find&mdash;&mdash;"  I clenched my
teeth and paused in the act of saying
something bitter, for somehow my cousin
Aurora's kind face came to memory.
"Ah!  Mademoiselle de Broglie, if there
was a being in the world to whom I
would lay open my whole heart&mdash;to
whom I would reveal the sad story of
my past life, it is to you&mdash;you to whom
I owe so much."
</p>

<p>
"Your sad story, do you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"At your years!" she exclaimed, while
Angelique relinquished her netting, and
her dark eyes dilated as she listened.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ah, mon Dieu!</i> this is terrible!"
</p>

<p>
I paused again, for I scarcely knew
what to say.  Aware that all the armies
of Europe had long been teeming with
desperate soldiers of Fortune, the exiles
of Scotland and Ireland, among whom
were the claimants of many attainted
titles, from dukedoms and marquisates,
down to simple knighthood, I felt almost
ashamed to reveal my real rank, lest she
might disbelieve me, and I should thus
lose her esteem.  I deemed it better to
remain as she deemed me, the poor
gentleman, the "<i>simple soldat</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Orphaned in my youth, the victim of
unmerited wrong and unjust malevolence
in manhood, there is not a human being
save my comrades, now I hope in England,
far away, to whom my heart clings&mdash;not
one who cares for me, or for whom I can
care&mdash;&mdash;".
</p>

<p>
"Except me, I pray you, monsieur,
except me," said she, smiling, and with
growing colour.
</p>

<p>
"And <i>me</i>," added Angelique.
</p>

<p>
I kissed the hand of each, and was
replying,
</p>

<p>
"Gratitude for the service I rendered
makes you kind, Mademoiselle de
Broglie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Gratitude?  Well, be it so," said she,
with her dark French eyes so full of expression,
that my heart beat quick and wildly.
</p>

<p>
At such times, was it not strange that
Aurora's image with her soft, bright
English beauty always came to memory?
Yet, what was Aurora Gauntlet to me, or
I to her?  So I thrust the obtrusive idea&mdash;the
little romance of the lace handkerchief&mdash;aside,
and gradually my whole heart
became filled with a deep and desperate
love for Jacqueline, a love I dared scarcely
acknowledge to myself.
</p>

<p>
Instead of replying to her last remark,
I again lifted her hand and bent my lip
over it; then she immediately rose and
left me, followed by Angelique.
</p>

<p>
Had I exhibited too much eagerness&mdash;had
I offended her?  My heart sank
at the idea.
</p>

<p>
Anticipating with hope and fear the
morrow, dreaming sadly or tenderly over
yesterday, ever communing with himself
when alone, and abstracted when with all
save one, what a miserable dog is your
young lover!  When one grows older,
and becomes a veteran in the service of
King Cupid, one learns to take these
matters more quietly, like an old soldier
under fire.
</p>

<p>
"Hope makes us live," says a writer;
it is the secret spirit that lures us toward
the future, to some mysterious time
beyond the present.  "Hope and sleep,"
says a proverb, "are the foes of care;"
but hope follows the impulses of imagination
rather than the convictions of reason,
and so hope is the lover's grand ally.
</p>

<p>
I remained alone on the terrace till the
red sun declined beyond the dun, dark
mountains, while the breeze of evening
rippled the bosom of the reedy lake, and
waved the white water-lilies that floated
there; nor did I retire to my
lurking-place&mdash;the pretty room which Angelique
had relinquished to me&mdash;until the pale
crescent moon shone sharply out, from
amid the deep blue of the south-western
sky, and two great ravens, whose eyry
was in the rocks, had winged their way
across the water, from the girouettes of
the chateau, where they were wont to sit
and croak for hours.
</p>

<p>
I have more than once seen Angelique
sign herself with the cross, on seeing
those two ravens, which she assured me
were no other than the doomed souls of
King Grallon and his daughter&mdash;for all
the land of Brittany teems with legends
of King Arthur and his knights of the
Round Table.
</p>

<p>
Did Jacqueline suspect the passion that
now preyed upon me?  By her knowing
smiles, Angelique certainly <i>did</i>, and would
no doubt inform her of it; then if she
deemed me presumptuous, or felt the
passion distasteful, would she not at least
shun, if she did not expel me from the
chateau?
</p>

<p>
But Jacqueline did <i>neither</i>, so day after
day stole on, until my love for her became
a part of my existence, for without her,
life seemed so valueless!  My passion
was tender and true&mdash;so tender that I
could have worshipped her, and in my
secret soul I did so.  The most simple
words spoken by Jacqueline&mdash;the most
casual smile on her lip, dwelt long
in my memory, and sank deep in my
heart.
</p>

<p>
Fancies I have had for others; but this
was the passion that seemed to satisfy <i>every
illusion</i>&mdash;to be the love of all loves that a
poor human heart could desire; at least I
thought so <i>then</i>.
</p>

<p>
And so, amid the wild and gloomy
scenery around that old and secluded
chateau in Bretagne our companionship
ripened from esteem and friendship into
love&mdash;but oh what a hopeless passion for
both!
</p>

<p>
Her image came ever, unbidden, when
she was absent; it pursued me and
became a part of myself; and where she
was not, what pleasure had I? and as
my mind became filled with this new idol,
my country, my duty as a loyal subject,
my honour as a soldier&mdash;liberty, all were
forgotten in worshipping Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
Alas!  I was not yet twenty!
</p>

<p>
Years have come and gone since then,
but never shall I forget the joy of the
time, when she first sunk on my breast,
and whispered in my ear, while her tears
fell hot and fast&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I love you, Basil&mdash;oh, I <i>do</i> love
you!  But in what can our passion end,
but destruction and despair?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
I BECOME A SOUBRETTE.
</h3>

<p>
Amid all this, we were somewhat flurried,
when, one morning in August, Madame
de Bourgneuf unexpectedly drove up the
long avenue to the gate of the chateau,
in her old-fashioned carriage, which
resembled a huge game-pie, or an antique
tea-caddy on wheels, and brought tidings
that the coast, from the Isle d'Ouessant
to Ostend, was more than ever closely
watched, as another descent of those
insolent heretics, the English, was
expected, for the express and envious
purpose of demolishing the elegant
fortifications erected by Marshal Vauban at
Cherbourg, and burning his Most Christian
Majesty's fleet, then ignobly blocked up
in Brest by the squadrons of Lord Anson,
Sir Edward Hawke, and Commodore
Howe, who, as an additional insult to
France, carried brooms at their mastheads,
in token that they swept the sea!
</p>

<p>
From the Governor of Brittany she had
obtained all this intelligence at St. Malo,
and I immediately received it from
Angelique, who, being somewhat addicted
to waggery and mischief, informed me in
a whisper, that "although madame, our
aunt, had resided so long at St. Malo,
ostensibly to pay her devotions at the
famous shrine of the cathedral, it was
more probably because the Duc d'Aiguillon
had appointed as Governor and
Commandant of St. Malo, the old Comte
de Boisguiller&mdash;father of the chevalier&mdash;who,
thirty years before, had been
madame's most devoted though unsuccessful
lover: and now as both were free,
she was not without hope of kindling his
passion again&mdash;hence the old lady's
devotion to the blessed bones of St. Malo;
but (added the soubrette, in the words of
Jean Jacques Rousseau) who ever heard
of a pair of grey-haired lovers sighing
for each other?"
</p>

<p>
Now, what the deuce was to be done
with <i>me</i>?
</p>

<p>
Madame was very strict about her
domestics, and had rather austere views
on the subject of men in general and
lovers in particular (M. le Commandant
excepted), yet, added Angelique, she
always prefers as a spiritual adviser the
handsome young Abbé St. Servand to old
Père Celestine, of St. Solidore.
</p>

<p>
Terrified by the prospect of immediate
discovery, of my ignominious expulsion,
perhaps punishment, poor Jacqueline
became quite paralysed, but her spirited
abigail rose superior to the occasion, and
resolved that a more complete disguise,
and an entirely new plan of operations
were at once necessary; so she insisted
that I should become, like herself, a
<i>soubrette</i> in the household.
</p>

<p>
Her clever little fingers&mdash;for she was
neat and ready handed as all Frenchwomen
are&mdash;soon prepared a dress of her
own for me, by letting out a tuck or two
in the skirts, altering the body and so
forth.  Then she proceeded at once to
have me attired, a feat I could never have
performed for myself.
</p>

<p>
She laced me up in a pair of her own
stays, a merciless process, which nearly
suffocated me, and certainly caused a
determination of blood to the head; "but
it was absolutely necessary," as she stated,
"that I should have a figure;" adding, as
she fastened the lace, "in time I shall
make you quite pretty, monsieur, and
then, if Boisguiller's hussars come this
way we shall be rivals for the handsome
sub-brigadier."
</p>

<p>
"Angelique, how you talk!"
</p>

<p>
"But the hussars&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk of them, pray.  The
thought of meeting hussars in this absurd
dress makes my blood run cold."
</p>

<p>
"Then, think of mademoiselle.  <i>Ma
foi!</i> a Parisian girl like her required
some one to interest, to excite her, amid
the gloom of this old chateau, with its
big rats and terrible legends, so you came
just in time to prevent her dying of
<i>ennui</i>.  But for Jacquot I should have
fallen in love with you myself."
</p>

<p>
She took great pains with me; a few
false curls adroitly pinned on, and one of
her own tall, coif-like Breton caps, of
spotless white linen, completed my head
gear.  She patted my chin, and thanked
Heaven I wore neither beard nor
moustache; then I joined her in a
hearty fit of laughter, on surveying
myself in a mirror.
</p>

<p>
"What would Jack Charters, Tom
Kirkton, or other fellows of ours, say if
they could see me thus!" was my first
thought.
</p>

<p>
Angelique taught me how to seat myself,
and how to hold myself when seated;
how to spread or gather my skirts when
ascending or descending stairs; and she
burst again and again into ringing fits of
laughter at the length of ankle I exhibited.
At last, after being well drilled, I
was taken to the drawing-room, and with
a heart that certainly palpitated, and a
cheek that blushed truly with shame and
ridicule, I was presented to madame, as
the new attendant of mademoiselle&mdash;a
girl from the wild marshes of the
Morbihan.
</p>

<p>
My costume was perfect, even to the
black velvet necklet, which no Breton
girl is ever without.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline grew very pale, but a smile
twinkled in her tearful dark eyes, when she
retired behind the chair of her aunt, who
bowed politely, and surveyed me through
her eyeglass, as I advanced, courtseying
at every second step, my hands folded
meekly across my breast, and my eyes
cast modestly down, in a manner taught
me by that pretty rogue, Angelique.
</p>

<p>
The idea occurred to me that a candid
confession of who I was, and the weight
of the mutual service Jacqueline and I
had rendered each other, would have
been better than the adoption of this
absurd and most dangerous disguise, which
could only serve to complicate the perils
of my present position; but there was no
resource&mdash;I was in for it now!
</p>

<p>
"Approach, girl," said the countess,
"come nearer me.  You have a very fair
skin for a girl from the Morbihan."
</p>

<p>
"My mother, madame, was an English
woman," said I, courtseying lower; to
have said a <i>Scots woman</i> would have
served my purpose better in France, for
the countess said, sharply&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So much the worse&mdash;so much the
worse, girl!  You have, however, I hope,
been well instructed in all religious duties,
and never omit mass or confession."
</p>

<p>
"Mon Père Celestine will answer for
me," said I, confident that the good priest
would protect me, whatever came to pass.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Très bien</i>!  I expect him to visit us in
a few days, together with the Comte de
Boisguiller, Commandant of St. Malo."  (This
reply, like a double-headed shot,
was not very restoring), "but why do
you require a <i>second</i> attendant,
Jacqueline&mdash;is not Angelique enough for you?
What is your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Basile, madame, so please you."
</p>

<p>
"Basile what?"
</p>

<p>
(The deuce take it!  I had not thought
of a name.)
</p>

<p>
"Basile Gantelet," said Angelique,
replying for me.
</p>

<p>
"Your parents and family?&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Were poor fisher people, all carried
off by the English fleet, and are now in
some horrid prison."
</p>

<p>
"The English, as Comte de Boisguiller
says, it is always those pestilent English,
we can neither move for them by land or
sea.  <i>Tres bien!</i> my good girl, I am
pleased with mademoiselle's choice, and
like your modest appearance so much,
that I think I shall retain you about my
own person.  If you please me, I shall
have your ears pierced, and present you
with a pair of my own earrings at the
next feast of St. Malo."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, madame, how happy I shall be
to attend so dear, so delightful, so
handsome a lady!" said I, courtseying thrice,
but feeling, nevertheless, in no way
delighted by the prospect of the ear-piercing
process.
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, my child," replied the countess,
with a gratified smile.  "Angelique will
instruct you in your new duties; and, as
you are from the melancholy district of
the Morbihan&mdash;the land of salt marshes,
and the Montagues Noires, of old feuds,
solemn pilgrimages, and ruined castles, I
shall expect you to entertain us with some
droll legends of especially those wicked
little fiends the Courils and Torrigans,
who infest the roads at nightfall, and
make travellers dance till they die of
fatigue."
</p>

<p>
Angelique hurried me away; our interview
had been most successful!  Madame
de Bourgneuf was now in her sixtieth
year.  Few women, even in blooming
England, are charming at that age; but
in France they are frequently horrible!
She could never have been beautiful at
any time, and though her hazel eyes
were large and bright, her shrivelled skin
had the hue of an old drumhead, that
had undergone the rain and marches of
three campaigns; yet, strange to say, she
bore a resemblance to her beautiful niece,
which made me ask tremulously in my
heart, would Jacqueline ever become so
plain, even if she lived to the years of old
Parr?
</p>

<p>
The countess had a profusion of real and
false hair, all of snowy whiteness, always
dressed <i>à la Marquise</i>, and by her ornaments,
and general style of attire, it was
evident that she knew not the art of growing
gracefully old; but was resolved to
be young, and to keep her colours flying
to the last.  With all this, she was a perfect
repertory of old stories of the court of
France, legends of the saints, and historic
memories of Brittany.
</p>

<p>
I soon found that my new attire
entailed upon me many annoyances.  I
strove to avoid all the domestics of the
chateau; but the jealousy and curiosity
of the women to see and to converse with
the new comer&mdash;this wonderful <i>paysanne</i>
of the Morbihan, who was constantly with
their young mistress, who could sketch in
her album, and knew <i>when</i> to turn over
the leaves of her music when she
played&mdash;together with the delicate attentions paid
to me by Urbain the gardener, Bertrand
the porter, the valets and the coachman,
became so alarming that I could scarcely
quit Jacqueline's suite of apartments, or
leave the chateau alone for a moment.
</p>

<p>
To all, I was a puzzle!  Some said I
was a clumsy Norman&mdash;a phlegmatic
Fleming&mdash;a Navarrese; the men declared
my bearing odd; the women, my accent
to be more so; but the gardener, with his
bouquets, was an admirer so devoted, that
I dared never venture into the garden,
or into the avenue, when he was clipping
the yews, or tending his orange tubs.
</p>

<p>
Then judge of my alarm, when one
day the mischievous Angelique, with her
black eyebrows arched to the roots of her
hair, her large eyes dilated with mock
dismay, and a smile of drollery on her
rosy mouth, began thus&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mademoiselle Basile&mdash;oh, how
unfortunate you are!"
</p>

<p>
"What has happened?" I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"Madame has conceived a greater fancy
for you than ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said I, drily, while smoothing
my front hair, before a glass; "then I
suppose she is going to have my ears
pierced at last?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ma foi!</i> what do you think? as she
is too much afraid of ghosts to repose
alone, you must take the place of
mademoiselle and me."
</p>

<p>
"What! ridiculous&mdash;I shall sell
out&mdash;resign&mdash;desert from the chateau!" I
exclaimed, while ready to sink with alarm
and anger, until the wicked wag who had
invented the whole story, burst out into a
fit of laughter, at the dreary expression of
my face.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
HAUTOIS.
</h3>

<p>
The absurdity and annoyance entailed by
my new character, together with the study
and trouble it cost me to play such a part,
would have been intolerable but for the
facilities it afforded me for enjoying with
perfect freedom the society of Jacqueline.
Thus, together we could ramble for hours,
in the shady walks of the garden, and the
green leafy turnings of the labyrinth, or
sit in the bowers of fragrant roses, which
were trained, trimmed, and cultured by
my admirer, the gardener, whose name I
shall long remember, was Urbain.
</p>

<p>
In the labyrinth we lost ourselves so
often that the countess one day, somewhat
to the confusion of poor Jacqueline, named
it the <i>Val sans retour</i>, after that in the
Breton forest of Broceliande&mdash;a mysterious
path, out of which no false or fickle
lover can ever return, for there the fairies
raise up an impenetrable and impassable
barrier.  In that forest, too, say the
legendaries, lies the tomb of Myrddyna,
beneath a fatal and enchanted stone.
</p>

<p>
If the curé of St. Solidore actually
paid madame the visit she spoke of,
discovery was certain.  I did not fear the
good man much, save a severe rebuke for
conduct that was unseemly; but then
there was that devil of a commandant
coming also from St. Malo, and already in
anticipation, I felt myself a prisoner in its
dreary casemates that overhung the sea!
</p>

<p>
This idea filled Jacqueline with terror.
</p>

<p>
"Give me up and leave me," said she,
with hands clasped upon her forehead,
while her tears fell fast, "to what end
do we love each other, Basil?"
</p>

<p>
"True, Jacqueline&mdash;to what end indeed!
But to give you up is impossible.  To
love you has become a part of my nature,
my existence&mdash;myself; and being with
you daily, has made that which was a
passion, a confirmed habit."
</p>

<p>
"In mercy do not speak thus, I love
you&mdash;love you dearly; yet our marriage
is impossible, and I can see no future but
despair."
</p>

<p>
"I know it," said I, gloomily and with
clenched teeth.  "Cursed be the fate that
threw us together&mdash;the folly that kept
me lingering here."
</p>

<p>
"Better would it have been that we
had never met."
</p>

<p>
"That I had never rescued you, do you
mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Or I you?" she would exclaim with a
sad smile; and then a long, long kiss
would close these interviews of mingled
passion, joy, and pain.
</p>

<p>
One evening, after escorting Jacqueline
to the door of the chateau, instead of
entering with her I returned to the garden,
for the purpose of dreaming over all that
had passed between us, and also considering
seriously the future, and what could be
the end of a love so rash and desperate as
ours.  Twilight had set in, and from the
garden I issued to the long avenue that
led to the Rennes-road.  It was dark
and gloomy, and the clipped yews assumed
all kinds of quaint and terrible forms.
While loitering there, I became conscious
that a man was observing me from behind
one of the orange tubs, one of which, I
have said, stood between each of the yews.
Having no desire to meet any one, I was
turning off hastily towards the chateau,
when suddenly the lurker stepped before
me, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu</i>, my pretty one, it seems that
he you wait for is not likely to come.
Permit me to offer you my arm."
</p>

<p>
He was a tall, swinging fellow of a repulsive
aspect, with a long knife in his belt and
a broad hat slouched over his gloomy eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Stand back, monsieur," said I, firmly;
"back, or it may be the worse for you.  I
am one of the household of Madame la
Comtesse de Bourgneuf."
</p>

<p>
"I know that well enough; but don't
be alarmed, my fair one&mdash;I am only a
sportsman."
</p>

<p>
"Then permit me to pass."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Oui</i>&mdash;but I am a sportsman who looks
for better game than a clumsy soubrette,"
said the fellow, whom I now perceived to
be tipsy.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vraiment</i>&mdash;perhaps Mademoiselle de
Broglie herself.  Does she often promenade
here in the evening?"
</p>

<p>
Gathering my skirts up to my knees, as
they sorely impeded me, I was running
quickly away, encumbered by my stays
and the paddings with which Angelique
in her zeal had furnished them, when this
man, who was both strong and active,
overtook and confronted me again.
</p>

<p>
"Stop&mdash;speak!" he thundered out with
a strange oath which I had somewhere
heard before.  "<i>Pardieu</i>, my saucy one,
I shall teach you that I have not dragged
a chain in the casemates of St. Malo, and
at the aqueducts of Dol, for nothing."
</p>

<p>
"You are&mdash;&mdash;" said I, gasping.
</p>

<p>
"Theophile Hautois," said he, closing
the question.
</p>

<p>
I was thunderstruck, and the memory
of Captain Brook, of the outrage he had
contemplated with regard to Jacqueline,
and my own narrow escape from his deadly
<i>couteau de chasse</i>, flashed at once upon my
memory.  I was unarmed, defenceless,
and sadly encumbered by my new costume,
though at the same time it effectually
disguised me.
</p>

<p>
I paused for a moment to recover my
breath, and then concentrating all my
strength and fury in one decisive blow,
dealt fairly between the eyes, I knocked
the ponderous ruffian down like a nine-pin,
and, darting off towards the chateau,
reached the vestibule in a state so
breathless and excited, that any one who saw me
would have deemed me a most timid and
gentle woman in reality.
</p>

<p>
What Master Hautois thought, on receiving
such a knock on the head from a
fair hand, it may be difficult to conceive;
but I saw no more of him for some time,
nor could he be found, though the whole
of the grounds were immediately and
rigorously searched by Urbain and a party
of armed men.
</p>

<p>
That this daring outlaw should prowl
so near the chateau filled Jacqueline and
her maid with the greatest alarm; and
for myself, I took the precaution to carry
about with me a small pistol, the charge
of which I frequently renewed.
</p>

<p>
In the boudoir of the countess (a charming
little circular chamber which opened off
the drawing-room, and was entirely hung
with rose-coloured silk, and had long
windows which overlooked the garden and
labyrinth), I was detailing to her my
adventure in the avenue, and was also
employed in the manly occupation of winding
a skein of silk for some piece of work which
her niece and Angelique were
manufacturing for the cathedral of St. Malo,
when the countess said to me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Basile, my child, you look very sad."
</p>

<p>
"Do I seem so, madame?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she continued, surveying me
through her glass&mdash;a process which
always made me wince; "I can read a sad
expression in your eyes."
</p>

<p>
"It may be so, madame, there are few
hearts without some hidden sorrow&mdash;some
veiled secret."
</p>

<p>
"But you are so young!  Ah, I see,
you are in love!"
</p>

<p>
"It may be so," said I again, with a
furtive glance at Jacqueline, near whom
I was kneeling, and who grew pale as
her aunt spoke.
</p>

<p>
"With some one far away?"
</p>

<p>
"Do not press me, madame; suffice
that it is a mad and almost hopeless
love&mdash;hopeless as regards its future," said
I, bitterly, while Jacqueline gave me a
secret and imploring glance.  "I love,
madam, how dearly and how deeply, is
known only to Heaven and myself.
There&mdash;that is my secret&mdash;that my hidden
sorrow and joy&mdash;joy for the delight
it gives me, and sorrow for its future."
</p>

<p>
The face of Jacqueline beamed with
pleasure, and her eyes sparkled as she
bent her flushed face over her needlework.
</p>

<p>
"I would that M. Jacquot would speak
thus of me," said Angelique, "I shall
pull his ears some day, till he does so."
</p>

<p>
The old lady politely asked pardon of
me for her curiosity, and was proceeding
to detail some of her own early experiences
and to rehearse the number of Counts,
Abbés, Chevaliers, and Grand Crosses of
St. Louis, who had sighed and died for
her, when a servant suddenly announced
the Chevalier de Boisguiller; then we
heard the clank of a sabre with the jingle
of spurs, and that gay hussar in his
brilliant uniform, all gold braid and bell
buttons, with his fur cap in one hand,
and the other caressing his dearly cherished
moustache, entered, bowing and smiling
to us all.
</p>

<p>
He was <i>en route</i>, he said, with his troop,
from Rennes to the coast, and as he would
pass near St. Malo, he had galloped on
in front to pay his respects at the
chateau, and obtain the honour of conveying
any message for his father, the
commandant, from the Countess Ninon&mdash;one
who far excelled the Ninon of the
preceding age.
</p>

<p>
There was mischief lurking in the
handsome fellow's eyes as he said all this.
He soon detected an impudent smile on
the lips of Angelique, and, ere long, I
found him eyeing me sharply through
his glass, and I felt a horrible dread lest
<i>he</i> should recognise me, or discover my sex.
</p>

<p>
I was certain the crisis had come, when
the hussar captain said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"By-the-by, my dear mademoiselle, what
did you make of the Englishman, whose
life you saved from my fellows, when we
were last here?"
</p>

<p>
"The young man who saved my life
from Hautois?" asked Jacqueline, slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, 'twas turn about, it would seem."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le Chevalier, he was taken
to St. Malo," said Angelique, who came
to the rescue of her mistress.
</p>

<p>
"And since then, my girl?"
</p>

<p>
"We have heard no more of him."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well," said the chevalier, who, as
his eye chanced again to fall on me, caused
my heart to swell alternately with alarm
and anger.  "Those English folks are
about to pay us a visit again."
</p>

<p>
"Again&mdash;<i>O mon Dieu!</i>" we all
exclaimed together.
</p>

<p>
"More shipping and troops are being
concentrated at their rendezvous of both
Portsmouth and Plymouth," said he,
while playing with the gold tassels of the
cord which held the furred pelisse on his
left shoulder; "but my father is ready
for them at St. Malo, and Brest and
Cherbourg are in excellent hands."
</p>

<p>
Though reflection or thought evidently
but seldom troubled our hussar, he now
proceeded to make some remarks with
which I, mentally, coincided.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu!</i> what did the King of Great
Britain propose to gain by invading France
with a force of about twelve thousand
men?  He takes a town or so, which he
cannot keep&mdash;he effects a landing under
great difficulties on our most dangerous
coast, and lands only to embark again."
</p>

<p>
"The British did not invade France
with the hope of conquest," said Jacqueline;
"but to harass us and destroy our
arsenals it would appear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, fair cousin, it may be so; but
as the Duc de Marlborough is not like
his namesake who fought against the
Grand Monarque, I don't believe our
courtiers at Paris or Versailles were very
much alarmed by this recent landing of
a handful of British at Cancalle Bay.  At
Versailles, they quite laughed at the idea
of John Bull's vast armament to burn
some fifteen or twenty old crazy hulks at
St. Solidore."
</p>

<p>
"Fifteen or twenty, monsieur," said I,
with unwise pique; "I thought the
British destroyed eighty-six vessels of all
kinds, and sank or destroyed two hundred
and thirty-four pieces of cannon."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Peste!</i> you are well informed, my fair
soubrette," said the captain, fixing his
glass in his eye, and giving me a steady
stare, while Jacqueline looked at me
imploringly, and with intense alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Peace, Basile," said the countess,
severely.
</p>

<p>
"But so many troops are now entering
Brittany from all points," resumed the
chevalier, "to strengthen the hands of the
Duc d'Aiguillon, that I don't think our
island neighbours will be so rash as to
visit us again."
</p>

<p>
Kettledrums were now heard in the
distance.  I felt my cheek flush&mdash;my ears
tingle at the sound; and when I looked
up from my skein of silk, the keen eyes of
Boisguiller were still regarding me.
</p>

<p>
"Already I must tear myself away,
countess," said he, rising; "my troop
will be here immediately."
</p>

<p>
"Why not halt for a time?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, madame, a hundred men and
horses are too many to trespass on your
generosity, as our advanced party did
before.  Adieu, mademoiselle!" said he,
kissing the hand of Jacqueline with a
tenderness that certainly was <i>not</i> bestowed
upon the yellow fingers of the Aunt
Ninon; "adieu, pretty Angelique&mdash;and
you, what is your name, mademoiselle?"
</p>

<p>
"Basile."
</p>

<p>
"Have you any tender messages for the
Queen's Own Hussars?  Believe me, girls,
you are both too pretty to become the
helpmates of charcoal-burners, and Breton
woodcutters; so think of <i>us</i> sometimes."
</p>

<p>
Then with a low bow the chevalier
pirouetted out of the room, and my heart
beat more freely when I heard his horse
galloping down the avenue.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE BOUDOIR.
</h3>

<p>
From a window I saw the hussars defiling
by threes, past the end of the long and
stately avenue of yews&mdash;along the road
that led from Rennes.  I heard the patter
of the kettledrums, and saw the glittering
sabres, the rich uniforms, the
waving plumes, the braided pelisses, the
gaudy housings of the horses, the sky-blue
standard with the three <i>fleurs de lys</i>, that
waved in the centre of the troop; and my
heart swelled with proud and regretful
emotions, as I thought of my present
absurd and dangerous position, of my
absent comrades&mdash;the lads who boasted
themselves "second to none," and with
whom I had twice ridden sword in
hand, through the ranks of Boisguiller's
Hussars.
</p>

<p>
That the chevalier was an ardent
admirer of Jacqueline I perceived but too
plainly; yet I did not dread him much
as a rival, especially as the Catholic
Church will not&mdash;unless in very
particular instances&mdash;permit the marriage
of cousins, and they were both within
the forbidden degrees.  But I dreaded
his discovering me&mdash;his probable revenge
for the insult implied by my residence
so near his cousin; and yet this chevalier
was a handsome, brave, and gallant
fellow.
</p>

<p>
I was roused from my reverie by a soft
hand that was laid caressingly on mine.
I turned, and met the pretty face and
dark eyes of Angelique.
</p>

<p>
"Twice, monsieur," said she, "I thought
our rogue of a chevalier had discovered
you; what eyes he has!"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Angelique: this chevalier,
who was so anxious to have me knocked
on the head when I first came here, does
he&mdash;does he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What, kiss me occasionally?  Of
course, every one does so sometimes&mdash;that
is, except you."
</p>

<p>
"I can soon make amends for this
unpardonable omission."
</p>

<p>
"That will do; <i>one</i> is enough, in that
dress especially.  Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Does he love your mistress?"
</p>

<p>
"He is her cousin.  Of course he loves her."
</p>

<p>
"The devil!"
</p>

<p>
"But every one does."
</p>

<p>
"Does she love him?"
</p>

<p>
"Can <i>you</i> ask me that?" said the
Breton girl, turning on me with her black
eyes flashing.
</p>

<p>
I was silent, for I now knew that the
prudent Angelique was completely the
mistress of our dangerous secret.
</p>

<p>
"Well has propinquity done its work!"
thought I.
</p>

<p>
I found the Countess Ninon very
amusing (though fond of recurring with
sorrowful recollections to her first love, a
Scottish captain in the Irish Dragoons of
Lord Clare, who had fallen in battle
somewhere); and notwithstanding the
little vanities incident to her years, sex,
and country, her conversation was
instructive.  Thus, while attending her and her
niece in their walks, &amp;c., I listened with
pleasure to her anecdotes of the court of
Louis XIV., and even of that of Louis
XIII., which she had gleaned from her
mother.
</p>

<p>
At night, when the perfumed wax-candles
were lighted in her boudoir, and
I was busy with my skeins of silk, while
she and Angelique plied their needles on
the embroidery for that Right Reverend
Father, the Bishop of St. Malo, she
would tell us many a strange old story of
the Breton wars between Guy of Thouars
and Philip Augustus; of the enchanted
sea-ducks that were neither fish nor flesh,
but grew between the planks of ships
that sailed in Breton waters; of the
toad-stones that were found in the mountains,
and proved a sovereign remedy for all
manner of poisons; of the terrors of the
Black Forest of Hunandaye; of the buried
cities of Is and Douarnenez; of the ghosts
that shrieked in the ancient vaults that
lie between Rieux and Redon, and the
subterranean torrent of St. Aubyn du
Cormier.
</p>

<p>
She knew also many strange and wild
legends of the great stones that stud all
the land so thickly from Lorient to
Quiberon&mdash;rising out of lonely heaths that
are covered with holly and thistles, like
that great block which marks, near
Morlaix, where a peasant was devoured by
the Moon, for blaspheming her.  She told
of the dreadful shipwrecks the Point of Raz
had witnessed; of the Bay of the Dead,
and the island of Sein, a melancholy
sandholm, whereon neither grass nor trees
will grow, and which was, of old, the
abode of Celtic witches, who sold fair
winds or foul to the Breton mariners.
</p>

<p>
I remember being particularly struck
with a strange story which she related of
the famous Ninon de L'Enclos, who is
said to have preserved her beauty until
she numbered ninety years.
</p>

<p>
We were seated in her boudoir.  It
was the fourth evening of my obnoxious
masquerading.  The eternal piece of
embroidery for the bishop was finished at
last, and Angelique was busy with the
soft, silky, and luxuriant black hair of
Jacqueline, which she had unloosed, and
was pinning up for the night, before a
large mirror, while I sat on a <i>tabourette</i> at
some distance, contemplating with secret
joy and admiration the beauty of one I
loved so much, and envying her soubrette,
a service which I could neither
imitate nor perform.
</p>

<p>
It would seem as if the beautiful girl
felt some coquettish joy in the contemplation
of herself, for after a pause she
said to her aunt&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Tell me honestly, my dear aunt, am
I as pretty as you could wish?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, Jacqueline."
</p>

<p>
"And you, Basile?"
</p>

<p>
I could only clasp my hands in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Yet," resumed Madame, "you are not
half so pretty as I was at the same age."
</p>

<p>
"When Milord Clare's Irish dragoons
lay at Versailles?" said Jacqueline,
quickly adding, "of course not, dear
aunt; I could not hope to excel you.
The old Comte de Boisguiller is always
polite enough to tell me so."
</p>

<p>
"Does he indeed?  Dear M. le Comte!"
said Madame, applying a gold vinaigrette
to her nose to conceal a gratified smile.
"You are charming, Jacqueline.  But
remember that faces which are pretty in
youth often become hideous in age."
</p>

<p>
"You were beautiful, aunt?"
</p>

<p>
"Like yourself, Jacqueline.  When
Lord Clare's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I do not care; I shall marry when young
and lovely, and when old and hideous my
husband cannot put me away."
</p>

<p>
"But he may love some one else."
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline glanced at me coquettishly
between the masses that overhung her
face, and her smile made my heart beat
lightly and joyously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, to be like Ninon de l'Enclos,"
said she; "always lovely!"
</p>

<p>
"Always?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear aunt."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the true, the terrible
story of the reckless woman you speak
of?" asked the countess, gravely.
</p>

<p>
"No; does it convey a moral?"
</p>

<p>
"A most severe one; shall I tell it you?"
</p>

<p>
"If you please, dear aunt, and if it is
not too dreadful," replied Jacqueline, as
she ran her slender white fingers through
the masses of dark hair that overhung her
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Then without further preamble, the
garrulous old countess commenced the
following narrative, which, to say truth,
I thought a very strange one; but the
subject of it was the bosom-friend of
Madame de Maintenon, of the Marquise
de Sévigné, and moved in the best society
of the very singular Paris of her day.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
STORY OF NINON DE L'ENCLOS.
</h3>

<p>
Ninon, I have said, had lovers when
verging on her ninetieth year!  Whence
came this mystery?  Like Poppæa Sabina,
the second wife of Nero, Ninon is averred
to have preserved her wondrous beauty
unimpaired to extreme old age, by using
baths of asses' milk; but it was neither
these, nor the famous cosmetic, so long
known among our Parisian belles as
<i>Crême de l'Enclos</i>, the component parts of
which are milk, lemon-juice and brandy,
which preserved the dazzling complexion
and delicate skin of Ninon for so many
years untouched by Time; but a spell
wrought upon her by the great master of
evil, whom she served throughout a long
and wasted life.
</p>

<p>
It would seem as if Time, the destroyer
of all things, failed to impair the charms
of Ninon, at least entirely, for he could
not deprive her of her marvellous power
to win and seduce; thus, at her age of
ninety, does not the Abbé Chaulieu say? "that
Cupid had retreated even into the
lines of her forehead."  Hence in age she
was worshipped for her beauty, by the
<i>grandsons</i> of those who had loved her in
the bloom of her youth!
</p>

<p>
Ninon was born at Paris in May, 1616,
during the reign of Louis XIII.  Her
father was a gallant, but dissipated
gentleman of Touraine, who had fought in
the battles of Henry the Great.  Her
mother was Mademoiselle de Raconis, a
lady of Orleans, from whom she inherited
her beauty and gaiety of disposition.
Monsieur de l'Enclos was passionately
fond of music, and inspired his daughter
with the same taste, so that in girlhood
she became mistress of the lute, the harp
and guitar; but Madame de l'Enclos, who
destined her for a convent, was averse to
such accomplishments as frivolities, and
was careful to take her daughter to Notre
Dame twice daily&mdash;that is, to morning
mass and to evening vespers; but little
Ninon always substituted for her missal
some little volume of poetry, or a romance
which she read under her veil, as she
knelt before the altar, thus her responses
were often very odd ones.
</p>

<p>
Before she was ten years of age she
had all Charron and Montaigne by heart,
and spoke with fluency the Spanish and
Italian languages.
</p>

<p>
In her fifteenth year, the death of her
parents left Ninon the mistress of her
own actions, with a fortune of ten
thousand livres per annum.
</p>

<p>
Her loveliness was then divine!  Her
form was finely proportioned, her
complexion singularly delicate; her face was
a fine oval, and long dark lashes with
drooping lids gave a charming softness to
her sparkling hazel eyes.  Her hair was
a rich golden brown, and fell about her
neck in wavy profusion.  Her little
nostrils, her rosy mouth and chin were perfect!
</p>

<p>
In temper she was at times violent and
imperious, and her disposition had this
peculiarity, that while even eager and
lively about trifles that affected herself,
she was too often carelessly cold and
selfishly indifferent about all that concerned
others.
</p>

<p>
She was born to be a coquette, and the
spirit of gallantry, with the desire to
charm, win and enslave, pervaded her
whole existence.  She was the centre of
Parisian fashion; lovers she had in plenty,
and if she desired to marry, some of the
proudest titles in France were at her
disposal; but Ninon, whom her mother had
destined for the service of God, preferred
a life of perfect freedom&mdash;such freedom
as the days of Louis "the Just" permitted,
with independence and intrigue&mdash;to live,
not for others, but for herself alone.
</p>

<p>
We shall see how all this ended.
</p>

<p>
One night in the year 1633, she was
seated alone in a room of her house in
the Rue de Parlement, behind the Palais-Royal.
Her lovers, the Counts de Coligné
and Jersey, and her favourite friends,
the Comtesse de la Suze, D'Olonne, and
the Duchesse de Bouillon-Mancini, the
cripple Abbé Scarron, M. de Sévigné, and
others, had all retired and departed in
their carriages or sedans, and Ninon was
now seated before a mirror in that famous
boudoir, the walls of which, as history
tells us, were decorated with frescoes, that
illustrated the story of Cupid and Pysche.
</p>

<p>
Ninon was now only in her seventeenth
year.  She observed that she was very
pale, that her round cheeks were colourless,
and some remarks made by the Abbé
Scarron on the decay of youth, the fading
of beauty, the gradual advance of years,
made the young girl thoughtful; and she
was too intelligent and too well-read to
be without reflection, so she thought of
the <i>future</i> with forebodings, for already
had late hours and gaiety robbed her of
her roses.
</p>

<p>
Arrayed for conquest, who at that time
could have competed with Ninon?  Round
her slender neck she wore the <i>collet-monti</i>,
or standing collar, which disappeared with
Louis XIV.; her fine hair was delicately
sprinkled with perfumed maréchal powder;
a kissing-patch, like a tiny star, was in
one of the dimples at the corner of her
rosy mouth, and her robe of silver gauze
was looped in ample festoons, to display
the petticoat of crimson brocade beneath.
</p>

<p>
Would a time ever come when she
would be covered with wrinkles, like the
Comtesse de la Suze, or when her most
passionate lover, the gay young English
Count of Jersey* would weary of her?
Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i> it was not to be thought
of with patience.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* William Villiers, Viscount Grandison, then
known in France by that title.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At that moment Guillot, her valet,
tapped at the door of her boudoir.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" she asked, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"A stranger, who would speak with
you, mademoiselle," replied Guillot.
</p>

<p>
"A stranger, and at this hour!  What
is his name?"
</p>

<p>
"He declines to give it."
</p>

<p>
"Ridiculous!  Is he armed?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mademoiselle."
</p>

<p>
"Is he young or handsome?"
</p>

<p>
"No, mademoiselle; he is very old and
shabbily dressed."
</p>

<p>
"Then say I am ill, weary, busy,
engaged with company, or what you please,
Guillot; only do not trouble me with
him."
</p>

<p>
The valet bowed and retired, but soon
returned.
</p>

<p>
"He says, mademoiselle, that he knows
you are alone, that you are neither ill nor
weary, nor busy, for which reason he has
chosen to visit you at present.  That he
has come from a long distance, and has a
secret of vast importance to communicate
to you."
</p>

<p>
"A pertinacious old fool!" muttered
Ninon; "but admit him."
</p>

<p>
The stranger entered, and with a
cunning leer in his eyes surveyed the
chamber, particularly the frescoes of
Cupid and Pysche, and then they rested
on Ninon, who for a moment, she
knew not why, felt the young blood
curdle in her heart beneath his sparkling
glance.
</p>

<p>
Her visitor was a little, decrepit old
man with shrunken limbs.  His coat and
breeches, "a world too wide," were of
black serge, and large black japanned
buckles covered three-fourths of his shoes.
He wore a high conical hat with a very
narrow brim.  This he removed on
entering, but still retained on his head an
old-fashioned calotte cap of black velvet,
the lappets of which hung down by his
withered cheeks.
</p>

<p>
His appearance betokened extreme old
age, but one that was healthy and vigorous
withal; for his eyes, which glittered and
sometimes <i>glared</i> through his black horn
spectacles, were wondrously large, keen,
and bright; and his hair, instead of being
grey or thin, was stuffed in masses,
coal-black and coarse, under the calotte cap.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, my dear Mademoiselle
de L'Enclos," said this singular little
personage, with a blunt and familiar, but
smiling nod.
</p>

<p>
"It is almost morning, monsieur,"
replied Ninon, with petulance; "the clock
of the Palais Royal has just struck
midnight, so pray what is your business with
me at such an hour?"
</p>

<p>
"That you shall learn, mademoiselle,
when your valet retires, but not till
then," replied the little man, with a
withering glance at Guillot.
</p>

<p>
Ninon was somewhat alarmed on hearing
this; but being impelled by an irresistible
power, she made a sign to the
wondering valet, who withdrew and closed
the door.  Then the quaint old man
immediately opened it, and on finding
that Guillot lingered with an ear at the
keyhole, he gave him a glance so piercing,
that he retired with considerable precipitation.
</p>

<p>
"Now, monsieur, your business?" said
Ninon.
</p>

<p>
"Were I young and handsome, like the
Count de Jersey, perchance you would be
less impatient," replied the impudent old
man, with a horrible grin, while applying
the forefinger of his right hand to the
side of his hooked nose, and winking one
of his wicked eyes; "yet confess, my
beauty, that your heart sinks when you
look on me?"
</p>

<p>
"It does," murmured Ninon, who felt,
she knew not why, on the verge of
fainting, and fascinated by the dark
stranger's glittering eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Be not alarmed," he resumed, blandly,
and with an expression in those serpent-like
orbs that was <i>not</i> a smile; "you
have nothing to fear from me&mdash;as yet."
</p>

<p>
"As yet!" repeated Ninon, breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, mademoiselle," said he, striking
his long silver-headed cane on the floor;
"you see before you one whom all
mankind&mdash;yea, and womankind, too&mdash;obey
and fear; one whom Nature hath endowed
with the rare power of dispensing
wondrous gifts.  I was present at your
birth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You?"
</p>

<p>
"I; and from that hour I have watched
your career, sedulously, and with
satisfaction, though unseen."
</p>

<p>
"This is folly or raving!" exclaimed
Ninon, gathering courage, and stretching
out her beautiful hand towards a bell;
but a sharp, fierce glance from the old
man's great goggle eyes restrained her,
and she said, gently, "What is your
object?"
</p>

<p>
"To inquire what lot you wish for
yourself in life."
</p>

<p>
"My present one is brilliant enough.
I have an income of ten thousand livres,
a house here in Paris, another at the
Cordeliers, a circle of delightful friends,
and lovers in plenty."
</p>

<p>
"Friends change and lovers too; beauty
fades, youth becomes age, and age
becomes wearisome and hideous."
</p>

<p>
"True; but I am only seventeen&mdash;for
seventeen years more, at least, I shall be
beautiful."
</p>

<p>
"You will then be four-and-thirty,
mademoiselle, when beauty begins to fade
and the ripe bloom of youth is past.
Then old age <i>will</i> come, and that is what
my friend De la Rochefoucault terms 'the
<i>hell</i> of women.'
</p>

<p>
"Your object, I repeat, monsieur?"
asked Ninon, glancing at the clock and
yawning without disguise.
</p>

<p>
"I come to give you the choice
of three gifts; firstly, the highest
honours in France; secondly, splendid
wealth; and thirdly, eternal beauty.
The world does not possess another
being who could make you the same
offers as I."
</p>

<p>
"You are either a quack or a fool,"
said Ninon, imperiously, as she laid her
hand on the bell to summon Guillot; but
again the great eyes of the quaint old
man daunted her.
</p>

<p>
"Choose," said he, emphatically; "I
have no time for trifling; rank, wealth,
or a beauty that shall endure without
change for four score years at least."
</p>

<p>
"Then give me the latter&mdash;eternal
beauty, that I may have lovers and adorers
for ever," said Ninon, laughing; "but
pray, my dear old man, how is such a
gift to be acquired?"
</p>

<p>
"By yourself, mademoiselle; it is very
simple.  Write your name with your own
lovely hand, in this book; swear to me
secrecy for life, and the thing is done."
</p>

<p>
He bowed, and advancing, laid before
her a very handsome pocket-book, bound
in scarlet, and richly gilt.
</p>

<p>
Ninon, heedless of the matter, and
neither believing in, nor caring for his
assumed powers, laughingly gave the
promise he required, and wrote her name
in his tablets, which he instantly closed,
and consigned to his deep breeches pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Now, mademoiselle," said the little
man, with a chuckle and a grimace, as he
waved his hands towards her, "receive
the power of possessing eternal beauty,
the power of controlling every heart, and
being beloved for long, long years, after
all who know and love you now are
consigned to the silent tomb."
</p>

<p>
"<i>All?</i>" said Ninon, almost sadly, as
she thought of the Count de Jersey, while
a strange thrill passed over all her body,
and a sensation like the pricking of needles.
Recovering herself, however, she said,
with a pouting lip, "Monsieur, you jest."
</p>

<p>
"That is not my habit," responded the
old man, with a wicked grin; "but when
I do jest, few laugh at me, even in Paris,
which I can remember when celebrated
for the extreme gravity of its inhabitants."
</p>

<p>
"When was this?"
</p>

<p>
"In the days of my friend Julian the
apostate, who says, in his amusing book,
the 'Misopognon,' that he loves our dear
Parisians on account of their <i>gravity</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you that say such things,
and pretend to so much power?" asked
Ninon, with displeasure.
</p>

<p>
"I am one who has known this lower
world, its heartlessness and trickery, its
crooked ways and its wickedness, for
exactly six thousand years, six months,
fourteen days, eleven hours, and fifty-five
minutes&mdash;the clock of the Palais Royal is
ten minutes fast, mademoiselle.  Adieu;
I shall keep faith with you.  Your beauty
shall last as I have said, and we shall
meet <i>twice</i> again."
</p>

<p>
"When?"
</p>

<p>
"Once at your house of the Cordeliers,
and again in Paris, during the next
century."
</p>

<p>
"The <i>next</i> century!" repeated Ninon,
with a laugh; "and this is but 1633."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly&mdash;adieu, mademoiselle," and
placing his conical hat jauntily on one
side of his moplike head of coarse black
hair, the old man put his cane under his
arm and bowed himself out.
</p>

<p>
How the enchanting Ninon slept that
night we have no means of knowing.  In
the morning she would have deemed the
whole affair a dream, but for the solemn
and reiterated assertions of her valet, who
had ushered in the nocturnal visitor; and
a dream she might ultimately have thought
it, had she not found that, beyond all
doubt, as years rolled on, as her young
companions became old, faded, and
withered, and were gathered to the tomb,
she still remained youthful, blooming,
full of health and spirit, and the possessor
of unimpaired loveliness.
</p>

<p>
The Count de Jersey joined King
Charles I., and died in 1643 of a wound
received at the siege of Bristol.  But the
heartless Ninon soon forgot him, and
others supplied his place.
</p>

<p>
Louis XIII. and Cardinal Richelieu
were taken to their last home; Louis
XIV. succeeded&mdash;the Augustan age of
France&mdash;the age which gave her such
soldiers as Turenne and Condé, such
literati as Racine, Corneille, and Molière,
such orators as Massillon, Bossuet, and
Lamothe Fénélon, and which saw the
exiled Stuarts repining at St. Germain;
but still Ninon was young and lovely.
She sedulously cultivated the fashions of
each age, and wore the extreme of the
mode&mdash;from the starched ruff of Louis
the Thirteenth's time, to the <i>coiffure à la
giraffe</i>&mdash;the towering head-dresses of the
early part of the eighteenth century.
</p>

<p>
As Le Sage says of Donna Inesilla
(under which name he introduces Ninon
in his novel of "Gil Blas") "she had
been idolized by the noblemen of the old
court, and saw herself adored by those of
the new.  Time, that spares not even
beauty, had exerted itself upon hers in
vain; he could not deprive her of the
power to please, and a noble air, an
enchanting wit, and graces that were
peculiar to her, made her inspire men with
passion, even in her old age."
</p>

<p>
So was it with Ninon, save that her
beauty never decayed.
</p>

<p>
In her fifty-sixth year she was residing
in her little country villa at the Cordeliers.
It was delightfully situated, and was
surrounded by a beautiful landscape, and
there she usually spent the months of
summer.  During this year she had also
spent the autumn there, to avoid a young
cavalier, who had followed her constantly
about the streets and public places of
Paris, and whose attentions thus had
caused her serious annoyance&mdash;all the
more, perhaps, that the young man seemed
somewhat poor, though very handsome
and extremely well-bred.
</p>

<p>
One evening Ninon was alone.  She
was reading "Les Amours du Grand
Alcandre," under which name her father's
comrade, the gay Maréchal Duc de
Bassompierre, narrated some of the love
affairs of Henri Quatre, when her page,
the grandson of Guillot, announced that
a gentleman in black, who would not
give his name, desired to speak with her.
</p>

<p>
She instantly thought of the mysterious
visitor of 1633, and tremblingly said that
he might be admitted.  Contrary to her
expectation, there entered a very
handsome young man, about four-and-twenty
years of age, dressed in a black velvet
suit, slashed with white satin, and wearing
a steel-hilted rapier slung in a white silk
scarf.  He knelt before her, and the
volume of Bassompierre fell from her
hand when she recognised the unknown
lover who had followed her like her
shadow about the streets of Paris.
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur," said she, "you weary me!
What is the object of your visit&mdash;and
what is your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Mademoiselle," said he, in trembling
accents, and with a flushing cheek, "I am
the Chevalier Guillaume de Villiers."
</p>

<p>
At this name Ninon started and grew
deadly pale.
</p>

<p>
"A lieutenant in the regiment of
Artois?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"The same, madame; but how know
you that?"
</p>

<p>
"It matters not how; but proceed."
</p>

<p>
"I was severely wounded when Turenne
forced the Spanish lines at Arras,
and again on our retreat from
Valenciennes, by the ball of an arquebuss.
The viscount sent me on leave to Paris.
There I saw you, mademoiselle, and have
dared to&mdash;to love you in secret&mdash;to love
you passionately!"
</p>

<p>
Ninon, who had been regarding the
speaker with mournful interest, now arose
and sprang back in dismay; for this
Chevalier de Villiers&mdash;this handsome
young man, so pale, so sad, and
gentle-eyed, was no other than her own son,
whom since his birth she had secluded in
the provinces; who never knew either
his mother, or his father&mdash;the Count de
Jersey; and who now by a strange fatality,
in ignorance of their relationship, had
fallen madly in love with her!
</p>

<p>
Then followed that terrible episode
which is so powerfully reproduced in "Gil
Blas."
</p>

<p>
Perceiving her confusion, and being
dazzled by her marvellous beauty, the
young officer took her hands in his, and
covered them with kisses; but Ninon
started back, and exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Beware, rash boy, and listen to
me!"  Then pointing to the clock on the
mantel-piece, she added, "Look there! at this
very hour, four-and-twenty years ago, I
was secretly delivered of you, Guillaume
de Villiers, in this very chamber.  <i>I am
your mother!</i>"*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* This episode is mentioned in the "Memoirs
of Ninon de l'Enclos," 2 vols.; published in 1776.
The story of her compact with Satan is an old
legend of Paris.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Abashed and terrified, filled with
mortification and shame&mdash;after a terrible
pause&mdash;the young man drew his long rapier;
and ere Ninon could conceive or arrest his
purpose, he placed the hilt on the floor,
and sprung upon the blade, which passed
through his heart, and killed him on the
spot.
</p>

<p>
Inspired with horror by this sudden
catastrophe, Ninon clung to the mantel-piece;
but a loud chuckling laugh made
her look up,&mdash;and lo!
</p>

<p>
At one of the open windows of her
chamber there stood a little old man clad
in sad coloured garments of an antique
fashion; his shock-head of black hair was
surmounted by a conical hat, which he
waggishly wore very much on one side,
and he was sucking the silver knob of his
cane.  Through his round horn spectacles
his eyes glared on Ninon with a malignant
smile she had no difficulty in
remembering.  He made her a low ironical bow,
and hobbled away with another chuckling
laugh which made her blood curdle.
</p>

<p>
Her lively nature survived even this
shock!  She returned to her house near
the Palais Royal, and amid the gaieties
of Paris, and her circle of friends and
admirers, among whom were some of the
greatest wits in Paris, such as Rochefoucault,
St. Evremond, La Bruyere, and
others&mdash;a circle that was ever being
renewed, she soon forgot the doubly
horrid episode of her house at the Cordeliers.
</p>

<p>
Christina, Queen of Sweden, became
one of her friends when at Paris, and was
so charmed by her conversation, that at
parting she declared to the whole court
that she had "never met with any woman
in France to compare with the illustrious
Ninon."  The latter was in her sixty-fifth
year when the famous General Sir
John Banier (the comrade of Gustavus
Adolphus), who fought at Magdeburg and
Leipzig, threw himself at her feet, as the
poor Chevalier de Villiers and many more
had done; but Ninon only laughed, and
said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My dear general, you will find that it
requires more genius to make love than to
make war."
</p>

<p>
So time passed on, and, as I have said,
at the age of fourscore Ninon was still
to all appearance young, and so charming,
that the Abbé Gedoine, a youth of twenty,
who had fluttered about her house in the
Rue de Parlement, became madly in love
with her; but Ninon was tiring now of
lovers, and even of life itself.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Ninon," said the abbé, "love has
too long been alike your amusement and
your occupation."
</p>

<p>
"My dear abbé," she replied, "the
most brief follies are the best.  I perceive
now, when it is somewhat too late, that it
was an absurd step in me to accept of you
as an admirer.  Let us carry the frolic no
farther, but fairly quit each other this
instant; and for the term of our natural
lives."
</p>

<p>
Thus, after inspiring a youth of twenty
with a real passion for her, was Ninon,
in her eightieth year, the first to break
off from him.  In short, from her first
boy-lover, the Count de Coligni, when she
was only seventeen, to the advent of the
Abbé Gedoine, her long life had been a
succession of conquests.
</p>

<p>
In the first days of October, 1706, an
illness of a kind so peculiar that it baffled
the best physicians in Paris&mdash;a languor,
wasting and helplessness fell upon Ninon,
but amid it she looked lovelier than ever,
though she was then ninety years and five
months old!
</p>

<p>
In succession had the doctors come and
gone, surprised and bewildered by a
malady for which they had neither a
name nor a remedy.  At last there came
one whom no one knew, and who requested
to see Ninon alone.
</p>

<p>
He was a decrepit, but hale little man,
very old apparently, though his hair was
coal-black.  He wore a dark suit, an
absurd conical hat, and large horn
spectacles, and leaned on a silver-headed cane,
which at every pace he planted firmly on
the pavement, as if he had a very good
opinion of himself.  In his left hand he
carried a pocket-book of scarlet morocco,
richly gilt&mdash;doubtless his book of pharmacy.
</p>

<p>
Propped upon a pillow, the dying
Ninon&mdash;for she <i>was</i> dying now&mdash;regarded
him with an awful expression in her
hollow eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember <i>me</i>, madame?" he
was heard to say, by those who loitered or
listened without.
</p>

<p>
"But too well," moaned the patient.
</p>

<p>
"Yet fair ladies have often brief memories."
</p>

<p>
"And I have been your dupe!  Begone,
fiend&mdash;you are powerless, and I defy
you!"
</p>

<p>
The old man uttered his chuckling laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Begone, I say, to that hell from
hence you have come."
</p>

<p>
"Then I go not alone!" was the strange
response, and there rung through the
chamber a shriek of agony, and with it
mingled the strange demoniac laughter of
the little man in black.  The listeners
heard also the stamping of his feet, and
exclamations of rage; then all became
still&mdash;terribly <i>still</i>.
</p>

<p>
When the door, which had hitherto
defied their efforts to force it, was opened,
the stranger could nowhere be found; he
had disappeared, hat, stick, spectacles and
all; but they found Ninon, and she was
no more.
</p>

<p>
The coverlet and other clothes were
disordered, the silk hangings torn; the
bed bore evidence that a fierce struggle
had taken place; but great was the
astonishment of all on beholding the
rapid change that came over her remains,
even while they gazed on them.
</p>

<p>
They were no longer those of the
seeming young and lovely beauty they
had known so long, but were turning
fast into those of an extremely aged
person.  The oval face became haggard;
the smooth forehead a mass of wrinkles;
the pearly teeth disappeared; the lovely
tresses of silky brown turned into a few
white straggling hairs, and the plump
pretty hands became shrivelled and
yellow.
</p>

<p>
Thus within one minute the remains
of the once enchanting Ninon turned into
those of an old&mdash;hideously old&mdash;woman,
who had died of strangulation, for on her
withered neck remained several marks,
made by the ferocious clutch of that
black stranger, who could never more be
traced.
</p>

<p>
This was on the evening of the 17th of
October, 1706.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
DISCOVERED.
</h3>

<p>
I had been disguised us a <i>soubrette</i> for
five days when those terrible events, by
which I lost my love, and nearly my
life, and had to leave the chateau, occurred
in rapid succession.
</p>

<p>
On the evening after we had listened
to the story of Ninon, I was seated with
Jacqueline in a secluded bower of the
garden.  The atmosphere was oppressively
warm, and I had removed alike the large
linen cap and the false curls with which
Angelique had supplied me; thus,
unfortunately, no one who saw me could for a
moment have doubted the sex of Basile,
the sham paysanne from the Morbihan.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline reclined with her head upon
my shoulder, and while seated hand in
hand, I was speaking of the apparent
hopelessness of our future, when she
interrupted me by saying,
</p>

<p>
"Remember, Basil, that at our age
nothing is hopeless either in fortune or in
love."
</p>

<p>
"True," I repeated, tremulously,
while gazing tenderly into her clear and
beautiful eyes; "yet, ere I saw you, love
Jacqueline, at times I was already sick of
life."
</p>

<p>
"Sick of life!  Your world in England
must be a horrid place, if people weary of
it so soon."
</p>

<p>
"You mistake me.  Every heart, as I
said to your aunt the other night, has
some secret sorrow, and I have mine&mdash;a
lost position.  Bravely did I bear the
cross till I was taken prisoner&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Do you deem yourself such?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean till I was left here, abandoned
in hostile France, thus crushing all the
brilliant schemes I had formed for the
future."
</p>

<p>
"Enter the service of France.  I have
vast interest through my father, through
my cousin Bourgneuf, and the Comte de
Boisguiller.  Who can say how high you
may rise?  We have still our Irish
Brigade and the regiment of Royal Scots,
and to be a Scotsman is still a passport to
royal favour in France."
</p>

<p>
"Was, Jacqueline; you should say it
<i>was</i>.  But that day has gone for ever, nor
would such views suit me if it remained.
I thank you, my beloved, but this can
never be."
</p>

<p>
A sound as of steps among the shrubbery
close by made us pause, and then Jacqueline,
after looking hastily round, asked&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Is the chateau becoming so terrible
to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! do not ask me that, at least in
such a tone of pique.  With you I should
indeed be happy anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"Should be&mdash;are you not?"
</p>

<p>
"I <i>am</i> happy."
</p>

<p>
"Then whence this repining, Basil?"
she asked, softly, perhaps reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"Understand me; it is the ever present
question, where will the love I bear
you&mdash;a love so deep and desperate&mdash;end?
Would it not have been better that we
had never known and never loved each
other so?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Basil, why?"
</p>

<p>
"You are the daughter of a peer of
France, the Maréchal de Broglie; I&mdash;oh,
Heaven! you know me but as an
unfortunate gentleman&mdash;a poor private
dragoon.  I have not even an epaulette to
boast of!"
</p>

<p>
"Then I shall give you <i>two</i>," said
Jacqueline, putting a white hand on each
of my shoulders, and kissing me playfully
on the check.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, it is too much!" exclaimed
a piercing voice; the hands of Jacqueline
were torn away, and Madame de Bourgneuf,
in all the rage of offended virtue,
dignity, and nobility, stood with pallid
face and flashing eyes before us.  "So,
so, this is Basile, the paysanne from the
Morbihan!  A man, a heretic, a foreigner,
a soldier in the arms of my niece, of
Mademoiselle de Broglie!  Oh, what
horror is this!" she almost screamed
aloud.
</p>

<p>
The rustling in the shrubbery is quite
accounted for now, thought I.  But I
was wrong, for keener eyes might have
detected the figure of a man&mdash;of Theophile
Hautois&mdash;lurking like a panther near us.
</p>

<p>
Jacqueline covered her eyes with one
hand, and clung by the other to the side
of the arbour.  Indeed, had I not
supported her she would have fallen, and now
there ensued a long and most painful
pause, during which I prayed the earth
to open and swallow me.
</p>

<p>
I was thunderstruck, and poor Jacqueline,
overwhelmed by dismay and shame,
cowered upon the seat with her sweet face
hidden by her hands.  Presence of mind
alone could save us now.  I waited until
the first paroxysm of anger was past, and
then addressed the too justly offended
countess.
</p>

<p>
Heaven only knows what I said then,
but love for poor Jacqueline and the
desperation of my own plight lent me
eloquence; thus rapidly and briefly I
related all my story since the morning on
which I had saved her life in the mulberry
wood near the well by the wayside that
led to our camp at Paramé, down to the
present hour.  Madame acknowledged
that she had overheard enough to
convince her that I loved her niece with
respect and tenderness, but added almost
fiercely that the vast gulf opened by our
difference of position rendered that love a
madness and a crime.
</p>

<p>
I acknowledged all this, and in terms
that I cannot now recal, urged for the
preservation of her family honour and
her own high name, the policy of preserving
secrecy in the affair; and she evidently
felt the force of my argument, as it was a
circumstance which would seriously
embroil her with her brother the Maréchal,
her son the Count de Bourgneuf, and
perhaps with French society in general;
though as a Frenchwoman she felt that
she could almost forgive anything that
had love for an excuse.  After a time, I
begged her to remember that I was an
<i>Ecossais</i>, and besought her by the memory
of the olden time, and her own early
predilections, to pardon Jacqueline, if not me,
for all that had passed.
</p>

<p>
This was assailing madame's weak point,
and a hectic flush crossed the pale cheek of
Jacqueline, as, no doubt, she thought of
"the handsome Scottish Captain of milord
Clare's Dragoons," of whom we heard so
much every evening.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Très bien, monsieur</i>; am I then to
understand that you are Scottish?" said
she, in a gentler tone.
</p>

<p>
"I am, Madame.  Let your favour for
one whom you have so often said was dear
to you&mdash;a soldier of fortune&mdash;plead for
me now."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis well that this <i>malheur</i> has
occurred here at my sequestered house,
and not at the Hotel de Broglie in
the Rue St. Dominique at Paris: but
let that pass.  We Bretons love the Scots
as the friends of our forefathers in the
olden time, and we all know that it was to
the love of a young Scottish girl our brave
Du Guay Trouin owed his escape from an
English prison, and that in her arms he
died in 1736.*  But this painful matter
must be ended, and a convent may cure
mademoiselle of an infatuation which
degrades her.  To drive <i>you</i>, monsieur, from
the chateau&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* A love for the Scots and dislike for their
fellow-subjects still exist in Brittany.  See
"Wanderings" there, published by Bentley, 1860, &amp;c.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The fate I own, with all humility, I
deserve."
</p>

<p>
"Would be to ensure your death: but
mademoiselle my niece has acted most
unwisely&mdash;even culpably&mdash;in not
confiding in me; and now you must be
separated, and for ever."
</p>

<p>
"Alas, madame!&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"This absurd disguise, monsieur, must
be relinquished, and to have you sent at
once from hence in safety, if it can be
accomplished, shall now be my task."
</p>

<p>
"I submit to your decision, madame,"
said I, with a sinking heart.  "Deep
affection causes deep submission, and to love
so fondly as I do, often causes more
sorrow than joy.  Dear, dear Jacqueline!"
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this!" interrupted Madame
de Bourgneuf, loftily and severely,
"Retire to your room, monsieur.  When
next I see you, let it be in the attire of
your sex, and dearly shall that minx
Angelique pay for her share in this
deplorable&mdash;this most unfortunate affair."
</p>

<p>
I bowed and retired, feeling in my
heart that Madame de Bourgneuf treated
me with great leniency, and such as I did
not deserve; for she might have
summoned her servants, and had me hanged
on the nearest tree, had such been her
will and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
I paused at the end of the garden-walk,
and looked back to the rose-covered bower.
The countess was regarding me with a
fixed and stern expression; but Jacqueline,
unseen by her, waved her hand to me
sadly in adieu.  My soul was wrung&mdash;if
I may use such an expression&mdash;wrung
with agony for the unmerited
shame thus brought on one who
loved me so well, who was so tender
and so true; and I cursed my own
selfishness.
</p>

<p>
I bowed in return, and hurried towards
the chateau.  Alas! that farewell glance
was the last we were doomed to see of
each other as lovers.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
SUSPENSE.
</h3>

<p>
I have but little courage to write of what
followed this upbraiding interview and
degrading discovery; for one episode of
horror followed another.
</p>

<p>
I resumed the green hunting suit of the
absent count, and Angelique was filled
with dismay when she saw me clad in
it, as she dreaded the punishment that
would be awarded for her connivance in the
recent masquerading; and moreover she
loved her young mistress dearly.  Then
she wept when she found it was ordained
that I was to depart secretly that night
on horseback, and that it was to be given
out that Basile the paysanne from the
Morbihan, had eloped or run away.
</p>

<p>
I was to be the bearer of a special
letter from madame to the Comte de
Boisguiller, Governor of St. Malo, charging
him by his old allegiance to her, and his
present friendship, to have me despatched
on board the first British ship that came
in sight of the city, or sent by an especial
boat to the Isle of Jersey: in short, to get
me out of the province at all hazards, and
quietly too.
</p>

<p>
It occurred to me that the count might
neither seek a ship nor send a boat, but
instead of obeying his venerable inamorata,
might cast me into a vault at St. Malo as
a prisoner; however, I felt so crushed, so
crestfallen and miserable by the sudden,
though not unexpected turn the matter
had taken, that for a long time after these
events I cared very little what became of me.
</p>

<p>
The evening drew on, and twilight
deepened into night.  Then Madame de
Bourgneuf, on inquiring for her niece,
found that she was not within the chateau;
on this she had the great bell rung
repeatedly to summon her from the garden
or grounds; but it rang in vain, for there
was no appearance of our Jacqueline.
After this the countess sent for me, and
addressing me sternly, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, my letter for M. le Comte
de Boisguiller is here, ready written and
sealed, the horse which is to bear you to
St. Malo is ready in the stable, saddled
and bridled, but you shall not pass the
gate of Bourgneuf until mademoiselle
returns to her apartment.  Do you
understand me?"
</p>

<p>
"I beseech you, madame&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Beseech me not!" she interrupted,
sharply.  "There is some other
trick&mdash;some vile plot in this prolonged absence
at an hour so unusual, and on the eve of
your departure, too; so I shall keep you as
a hostage for her."
</p>

<p>
But as the first hours of this anxious
night drew on, the surprise of the countess
and her household took the new phase of
alarm and fear, a feeling that was quickened
by my repeated assurances of ignorance,
and my too evident deep anxiety.  The
avenue of yew and orange-trees, the lawn
and its shrubbery, the borders of the lake,
the garden, the labyrinth, and every room,
turret, and corner of the chateau, were
rigidly searched without success, for no
trace of the missing one was found, till
Urbain the gardener picked up, near the
door of the bower in which we had been
seated when madame discovered us, a
small kid glove and a gold bracelet, which
we knew belonged to Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
Near these, on a bush, were some
fragments of lace torn from her dress; and
when inspected by lantern light the
garden-walk and border bore evidence of a
struggle; the flowers were crushed and
bushes torn, and in the earth were the
deep footmarks of a man who wore sabots.
</p>

<p>
About ten yards from the bower we
found a small axe, which had been lost
or cast away.  It was such as woodmen
generally used, and cut upon the handle,
appeared the name of T. HAUTOIS!
</p>

<p>
The deductions we drew from these
traces and indications filled my soul with
the keenest alarm and horror!
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
That Jacqueline had been violently
assaulted, carried off, and perhaps killed
ruthlessly by this outlaw, who had so
long vowed vengeance on her family, and
whom Jacquot and I had both seen
lurking in the grounds during the past week,
seemed beyond all doubt.  Of his extreme
cunning, ingenuity, and of the length his
daring and brutality could carry him, I
had already had ample proof, and my
heart sickened as imagination pictured
the gentle, soft, and delicately nurtured
Jacqueline, writhing and helpless in his
felon hands.
</p>

<p>
The lamentations of Angelique and the
female domestics were mingled with the
oaths and maledictions of the men, who
proceeded at once to arm themselves
with muskets and pistols; and now it
was that Madame de Bourgneuf, in her
despair, was disposed to rely on me.
</p>

<p>
She pressed my hand in hers, and said,
in a broken voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, if you ever loved my niece,
as you say you do, aid in her rescue from
this demon!"
</p>

<p>
I returned the pressure in silence, and
was making preparation to scour the roads
and thickets which covered all the district,
when, amid our consternation, the tramp
of horses was heard, and the Chevalier de
Boisguiller, accompanied by twelve
hussars, rode hurriedly up to the gate.
</p>

<p>
The countess was standing on the front
door-steps of the chateau, pale, trembling,
and her eyes red with weeping.  Some
ten men, including Urbain, the valets,
gardeners, and grooms, stood around her,
loading their arms, fixing and snapping
their flints and lighting torches and
lanterns, for darkness had long since set
completely in.
</p>

<p>
The Chevalier dismounted, threw his
bridle-reins to a hussar, and advancing to
the countess, said, with a smiling bow&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Peste!</i> but I seem to have come at a
critical time, madame.  Has the lake been
poached&mdash;the hen-roost robbed, or what,
that you are preparing to take the field
like a chatelaine of old?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, chevalier, you have indeed come
at a most critical time.  Heaven itself
must have sent you!"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all," replied the heedless
hussar.  "I am such a sad dog that I
fear Heaven has long since given me up
as incorrigible, but I have been sent here
by order of the count, my father, with a
sergeant and twelve troopers.  You must
learn, that on the day I had last the
honour to visit you, a letter came to the
commandant of St. Malo&mdash;a private letter,
oddly spelled, on a very crumpled piece
of paper, and bearing the feigned
signature of Theophile Damien, but bringing
information that an English spy was
secreted <i>here</i>.  So, as duty compelled the
count to see into the matter, and
friendship urged that he should spare you an
affront, he despatched me to make the
necessary inquiries.  Now I remember
me of a soubrette of my cousin's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur le Chevalier," said the poor
countess, speaking rapidly amid a torrent
of tears, "the person of whom you speak
is no spy&mdash;for that you have my word of
honour."
</p>

<p>
The chevalier bowed low, with his right
hand on his heart, accepting the pledge
for me.
</p>

<p>
"He is no spy, and must be protected.
He it was who saved the life of Jacqueline,
and will peril his life with you to save
her once again, if indeed it be not too late
already."
</p>

<p>
"Again&mdash;too late&mdash;what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"She means, chevalier," said I, "that
Mademoiselle Jacqueline has been torn
from us by a ruffian of the most daring
and unscrupulous character&mdash;by Hautois,
the galley-slave."
</p>

<p>
"Hautois!" repeated the chevalier, with
indescribable alarm.
</p>

<p>
"By Hautois, and thus your arrival is
most opportune.  I am the person referred
to in your orders; but for Heaven's sake&mdash;for
the sake of Mademoiselle Jacqueline,
waste no time or thought on me.  I
will assist you, aid you with my life to
save, to rescue her, and after that is
achieved, deal with me as you will."
</p>

<p>
For a full minute the Frenchman
seemed to lose his invincible self-possession
on hearing all this, but in a few
words I acquainted him with what had
occurred, and urged the necessity of
immediate action.  On hearing the name
of Hautois, with whose story he was
familiar, the chevalier changed colour, and
appeared much disturbed and alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"If 'tis he, we have indeed no time to
lose," said he, through his clenched teeth;
"but the pursuit must be on horseback&mdash;the
servants can beat the woods, while
my hussars shall scour the roads.  You
ride, monsieur, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
Under other circumstances I might
have smiled at the question, but then I
simply replied in the affirmative.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bon!</i> then get a horse from the stables,
and let us begone."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes our plan was detailed,
and we all separated, inspired by anxiety
and excitement.  Three hussars took the
road towards Dinan; three towards
St. Paul le Plenguen; three on that which
led to Montford, and other three on that
which led towards Rennes.  The armed
servants under Urbain the gardener and
the porter, who had been once a soldier,
proceeded to search the woods and forests,
while the chevalier and I departed at a
gallop towards St. Aubin du Cormier,
stopping for inquiry every person we met
on the road.
</p>

<p>
The chateau was to be our point of
rendezvous.
</p>

<p>
"Save her&mdash;bring her home in safety,"
were the parting words of the countess,
"and I vow to God to hang a silver lamp
worth a thousand livres on the altar at
Roscoff!"
</p>

<p>
This was a little chapel near Leon in
Brittany, built by Mary Queen of Scots,
in memory of her landing there during a
storm when on her voyage from Scotland
to France.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE BLOODHOUND.
</h3>

<p>
"When nothing remains of an adventure,"
writes some one, "it is always possible
to consider it a dream."  As yet I
could not realize this, though frequently
asking of myself, Is all this sudden
calamity a truth?&mdash;for I thought, spoke,
and acted as one who dreamed.
</p>

<p>
But three hours&mdash;they seemed so many
ages&mdash;but three hours ago, I had been
seated in yonder garden-bower with
Jacqueline, listening to her voice, while her
cheek reclined upon my shoulder, fearing
nothing save the shadowy future, thinking
of ourselves and of our love alone.
</p>

<p>
<i>Now</i> how all was changed!
</p>

<p>
I had been discovered, and all but
expelled from the chateau, while she had
been abducted, and by such an abductor!
Now I was riding side by side with a
French officer&mdash;his comrade for the time&mdash;and
he was that Chevalier de Boisguiller,
who had been so long my <i>bête noire</i>.
</p>

<p>
At the very moment I was thinking of
all these things, what might be the peril,
the suffering, the desperate extremity of
Jacqueline!  Where was she, and how
circumstanced in the power of a brutal
galley-slave?  Might we not be riding in
the wrong direction, and thus, perhaps,
abandoning her to the very fate from
which we sought to save her?  The stars
that looked so brightly down on us looked
also down on her; but where was she?
Every thought and fear was maddening!
</p>

<p>
When contrasted with my own keen
anxiety, the <i>sang-froid</i> of the French
officer piqued and annoyed me.  It was
well for me, however, that he was ignorant
of the relation that existed between his
cousin and me, as, apart from any fancy he
might himself have had for her, in the
extreme ideas of difference of rank, religion,
and so forth, cherished by the French <i>noblesse</i>,
he would have thought no more of quietly
pistolling me, on the score of presumption,
than of shooting a weasel.  Thus my
ill-concealed emotions he put down in his
own mind as the result of humanity and
gratitude.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mon ami</i>, I rather like you," said he,
as we rode on together; "I can see that
you are courageous, and that is better than
to be merely brave."
</p>

<p>
"Merely brave&mdash;what do you mean, chevalier?"
</p>

<p>
"We French make a distinction in
this matter.  A soldier may be very
brave, and yet on some occasions
may not have courage to manifest his
bravery."
</p>

<p>
"I confess that this paradox is too
subtle for me, especially at such a time.
But tell me, chevalier, was this wretch of
whom we are in pursuit ever in the
French service?"
</p>

<p>
"I regret to say that he was, until
discharged with a <i>cartouche jaune</i> as an
incorrigible rogue."
</p>

<p>
He referred to the discharge printed on
yellow paper and given to those men of
the French army who were dismissed under
sentence of degradation.
</p>

<p>
For a few miles we diverged into every
cross path, but always returned to the
main road; and we questioned closely
the few persons, chiefly charcoal-burners,
whom in that sequestered region we met
abroad at such an hour, but questioned
them in vain.
</p>

<p>
Thus the short night of August was
soon spent.  The clear stars still shone
brightly in the blue sky; but already there
were indications of the dawn that was at
hand, for a warm flush was stealing over
the east when we found ourselves at
Fougères, a little town situated on the
river Nanson, having some leather
manufactories and a strong old castle
wherein the lords of that <i>Seigneurie</i>
resided.
</p>

<p>
There we turned our horses without
prosecuting our inquiries, as it was by no
means likely that those of whom we were
in search would be found in a busy town.
</p>

<p>
So the night had passed away&mdash;a night
without tidings of Jacqueline!
</p>

<p>
Broader and deeper grew the light of
morning, and clouds of sombre grey or
purple that overhung the mountains and
seemed to roll along their distant ridges,
became lighted up and edged with saffron
and gold.
</p>

<p>
We were returning at a canter along
the highway to Bourgneuf, in the hope
that on reaching that place we might find
that some of our searchers had returned
with happy tidings and better success than
ourselves; but we had scarcely proceeded
two miles when we met Urbain the
gardener and Bertrand the porter, each
armed with a musket.  They were accompanied
by an old peasant, whose head was
bound about with a cloth to conceal a
wound, which seemed to have bled profusely.
</p>

<p>
They had been scouting in the woodlands
which bordered the highway, and
had there met this peasant, who was a
woodcutter, and who informed them that
he had seen a man dragging a woman
towards the forest of St. Aubin du Cormier,
and that when attempting to interfere
when she claimed his succour and
protection, her captor struck him down with
the butt of a heavy pistol.  This
rencontre occurred about three miles from
the place where we were then speaking.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu!</i> this is valuable intelligence,"
exclaimed Boisguiller; "but how shall
we track them through these dense
thickets?"
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur, you cannot do it on horseback,"
replied the peasant; "but as my
hut is close by, you may leave your horses
there, and then, as I should like to repay
that cowardly rascal for the tap he gave
me on the head, I shall give you sure
means of tracking him, for I have in
keeping a Spanish bloodhound belonging
to Monseigneur the Count of Fougères,
and it is completely at your service."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you for this great aid, <i>mon
ami</i>," said my companion; "the count
knows me well&mdash;I am the Chevalier de
Boisguiller, son of the Governor of
St. Malo."
</p>

<p>
On hearing this the peasant made a
succession of low bows, scraping the turf
with his sabots at each.
</p>

<p>
The reader may imagine the haste and
satisfaction with which we availed
ourselves of the offer of the old woodman,
and as we proceeded to his humble hut,
which was situated close to a bend of the
Nanson, I questioned him closely and
anxiously about the appearance of the
persons he had seen.  The tall, powerful
man in a common blouse and fur cap, with
a girdle and <i>couteau de chasse</i>, was as
certainly Theophile Hautois as the poor pale
girl with torn dress and dishevelled hair,
whose hands he had tied with a cord, and
whose mouth he had gagged with a
handkerchief, was certainly our Jacqueline.
</p>

<p>
His description made me tremble with
anguish and rage, and Boisguiller to gnaw
the ends of his moustaches.  We quitted
our saddles, stuck our pistols in our girdles,
and had the bloodhound brought forth.
</p>

<p>
"Messieurs," said the woodman, as he
led forward the dog by a strong steel chain,
"there is not in France, and certainly not
in Bretagne or Normandy, a <i>limier</i> with a
finer nose than this; and set him but once
upon the track of those we seek&mdash;let
the distance between us be ever so
great, and let it be through the thickest
woods and by the most covert paths&mdash;ay,
<i>pardieu</i>, by the Blackwater of St. Aubin
du Cormier, this dog will trace them."
</p>

<p>
"To the proof, without delay!"
exclaimed the chevalier, while I examined
attentively the ferocious brute on whose
instincts our hopes depended.
</p>

<p>
Its back was about thirty inches high,
its limbs exhibited vast muscle, and its
chaps were long, pendulous, and frothy.
It was of a deep dark-brown hue, and was
of that breed which the Spaniards once
used with such terrible effect on the
continent and adjacent isles of South
America.
</p>

<p>
Leaving our horses at the hut, we
retraced our steps, and entering the wild
forest, which more or less covers all that
part of the country, an hour's walk
brought us to the place where the
woodman had encountered Hautois and his
victim about seven hours before&mdash;at
midnight, in fact, and he assured us of the
place by showing on the grass traces of
the blood which had flowed from the
wound inflicted by the outlaw's pistol-butt.
</p>

<p>
The fierce hound inserted his square
muzzle among the grass and sniffed up
blood, on which the peasant gave him a
kick, saying,
</p>

<p>
"<i>Voila, mon ami!</i>&mdash;come, come, 'tis not
my blood we wish you to sniff at so
pleasantly, but the blood of another."
</p>

<p>
"True," said Boisguiller, "but how are
we to give him the scent of Hautois, or
of the lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Morbleu!" grumbled the woodman;
"I did not think of that."
</p>

<p>
"Had we but a piece of mademoiselle's
dress!" said Urbain.
</p>

<p>
"Here are what we require," said I, in
a voice all but breathless with emotion,
while drawing from my breast the kid
glove and fragment of lace which we had
found near the garden-bower.  The
chevalier gave me a keen glance, and
snatching the relics almost abruptly from
my hand, pressed them against the black
nostrils of the dog, patting him soothingly
the while.  The glove was perfumed fortunately,
and thus, in a minute or less, the
dog, after sniffing and snorting about
among the grass, with his head bent low
and ears drooping, began to run rapidly
through the forest, straining on his collar
and chain, and dragging after him the
peasant who grasped the other end
of it.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu, messieurs!</i> he is on the track
now!  See how he follows the scent!"
exclaimed the old man, who was compelled
to run fast to keep up with the dog and
with us.  "Oh! by St. Malo!  See, here
are the footsteps, the crushed leaves, the
broken twigs!  'Tis this way they have
passed, messieurs.  <i>Ah! sacré coquin!</i>
That tap on the head shall cost thee dear.
Look to your pistols, monsieur le chevalier,
for <i>he</i> has a pair, and I know not the
moment we may come upon him."
</p>

<p>
Thus surely guided by the searching
instinct and unflinching pertinacity of the
hound, we hastened through the forest in
silence, and with hearts full of intense
anxiety and hope.
</p>

<p>
The dog was sometimes at fault when
runnels of water crossed our path, but the
peasant, who was an acute old fellow,
with a face of the true Breton type&mdash;eyes
that were deeply set and thoughtful,
a high nose and square forehead&mdash;soon
set him right again.
</p>

<p>
What must poor Jacqueline, so delicate
and so tenderly nurtured, have suffered
while forced to pursue such paths as
these?  We were now at least eight miles
distant from Bourgneuf, and for her to
have been dragged through a forest at
midnight, and by such hands!
</p>

<p>
The idea was too dreadful to embody
in fancy, so let me hasten over what
follows.
</p>

<p>
At a part of the forest which was so
dense that the intertwined branches of the
trees almost excluded the light of the sun,
the dog stopped at the root of a large
elm, and began to bay loudly over some
tufts of grass, leaves, and branches
that were freshly heaped up there.  He
snorted, growled savagely, and then
proceeded to tear up the little mound with
his nose and forepaws.
</p>

<p>
"The scent ends here," said the peasant,
looking somewhat bewildered and
alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"There must be some mistake," said
the chevalier, with annoyance in his tone;
"we have been in pursuit of the wrong
person.  But some mystery may be
concealed here.  Urbain, Bertrand, scrape
aside this heap, and let us see what the
dog's nose has discovered."
</p>

<p>
They readily plied their musket-butts,
and then their hands, while I stood by,
feeling more dead than alive, for the
horror of anticipation overcame me.
</p>

<p>
A bit of an orange silk dress appeared.
Let me endeavour to write briefly and
calmly of what followed.
</p>

<p>
In a hollow, a hasty grave, half dug
and half heaped up, about three feet deep
in all, we found the body of Jacqueline,
covered by leaves, branches, and tufts of
grass.
</p>

<p>
She lay upon her back; her right hand,
so small and beautiful, clutched a tuft of
grass; the teeth were clenched&mdash;there was
no relaxation of the jaw&mdash;clenched as
if with agony, and foam was plainly
discernible on the white and parted lips;
yet she was lovely like a dead angel, and
all the divine serenity of innocence was
there.
</p>

<p>
Standing aloof like one transfixed or
petrified, I saw them raise her up, and
saw her head drooping pendulously backward
with its long dishevelled hair clotted
with blood, the bare bosom and the
tattered dress.
</p>

<p>
Then I heard Boisguiller exclaim in
accents of horror,
</p>

<p>
"She is dead now; but that mere
wound could never have killed her&mdash;<i>she
has been, stunned and buried alive</i>!  Poor
Jacqueline!  What she has endured ere
death released her, her lips can never tell
us now."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE FOREST OF ST. AUBIN DU CORMIER.
</h3>

<p>
When my thoughts took some coherence
again, evening had come on, and I found
myself alone and still in a forest&mdash;alone
with the bloodhound, whose steel chain I
grasped with an unyielding hand.
</p>

<p>
I heard the rising wind shaking the
tops of the lofty oaks.  I remembered
now, like one who, after a long and deep
slumber, recals the passages of a dream,
that near the tree beneath which we
found <i>her</i>, Urbain the gardener had picked
up a fur cap, which I had no difficulty
in recognising as one that had been worn
by Hautois.
</p>

<p>
This furnished the dog with a scent,
put us on his track, and the livelong day
we had followed it, like Indians on the
trail of an enemy.
</p>

<p>
One by one, Guillaume de Boisguiller,
Urbain the gardener, Bertrand, the old
porter, the peasant, and others, had dropped
behind in weariness; but I, taking the
dog in hand, inspired and endued by
revenge with thrice my natural strength,
had urged the pursuit alone, through wild
thickets, up rough ravines, and across
streams and torrents, while a pale face, in
awful repose, with eyes glazed and half
open, and a mouth the lips of which were
two blue lines, seemed to lead me on&mdash;and
on I went, unflinchingly and unswervingly.
</p>

<p>
Gradually there came a horrid calmness
to my mind&mdash;the calmness that follows a
shock&mdash;a grief too great to last; and
there was something soothing in the
conviction that Hautois could not escape
me; that so surely as if I held an
enchanted clue or magic wand I could
track him now, if I husbanded my
strength, and I could have kissed the
ferocious dog that led me on his devious
and secret track.
</p>

<p>
What had she suffered&mdash;my poor
Jacqueline!&mdash;how much endured ere death
came to her release!
</p>

<p>
It may seem strange, but I had a grim
satisfaction in the knowledge that her
sufferings were all over now&mdash;that she
was at rest, at peace, and that she would
see how fearfully I would avenge her.
</p>

<p>
But how, was the startling question or
thought which occurred to me; for in the
rapidity of my pursuit through the thickets
of briars and matted shrubs in which I
had to make my way, up the rocks which I
had to climb, or down which I had to leap,
the pistols had dropped from my girdle,
when or where I knew not, and thus I
was&mdash;defenceless!
</p>

<p>
Yet I heeded not even this terrible
conviction; my only desire was to reach,
to meet and to grapple with Hautois&mdash;weary
though I was, to grapple with him
bare-handed, and trust the rest to youth
and strength, to justice and to God.
</p>

<p>
When twilight was setting in I found
myself in a very wild place.  The dog
was conducting me up a ravine the sides
of which were covered with vast blocks
of basalt, the <i>débris</i> of some earthquake.
In rank luxuriance the weeds and wild
flowers covered them in many places.  On
both sides of this wilderness of rocks
grew a dense forest, the timber of which
was of several kinds; but the underwood
seemed to consist of wild apple-trees.
Great mountains of rock bordered this
forest on one side; on the other it stretched
away into the gloom of evening and the
obscurity of distance.
</p>

<p>
Although I knew it not, I was then in
the forest of St. Aubin du Cormier, so
named from the prevalence of the <i>cormier</i>,
or sorb-apple tree&mdash;that forest through
which flows the subterranean torrent
which forms one of the natural wonders
of the province.
</p>

<p>
On reaching the head of the ravine, the
dog led me through a mass of brushwood,
by a path so narrow that it seemed to be
such a track as the feet of wild rabbits
might form, and then I found myself
before a large hut, or <i>chaumière</i>, of
dilapidated aspect.
</p>

<p>
It was built of stone blocks, and heavily
thatched with heather and straw.  The
door, which was opened by a wooden latch
of primitive construction, was old and
worm-eaten, but seemed to have been
once strong and well made.  I afterwards
found that a bar of oak secured it
transversely on the inside.
</p>

<p>
Arming myself with a stone, I boldly
entered this hut, and found it deserted.
On the hearth there smouldered a fire of
wood, turf, and fir-cones, showing that it
had been recently occupied; and by the
light of this, and the last flush of the set
sun which stole through the little window,
I could observe the squalor and wretchedness
of the place.  A few pots of brown
ware, a couple of ricketty stools, an old
chest, a hunting-belt that hung on a nail,
and a few sheepskins that lay in a corner,
as if to form a bed, were all the furniture
of this cheerless abode.
</p>

<p>
As I surveyed it, the bloodhound
licked my hand with his hot, steaming
tongue, and whined, rubbed himself against
me, and scented about, as if with
satisfaction; then he lay down at my feet,
lashing the floor with his thick, heavy tail,
as if to inform me that we were in the
lair of Hautois&mdash;of this human panther!
</p>

<p>
But would this man return to it after
the deed he had perpetrated?
</p>

<p>
I could scarcely doubt it; the <i>chaumière</i>
was in an utter wilderness, and while
lurking there he must have committed
many a crime ere this.
</p>

<p>
Would he return alone?&mdash;if not, I had
perhaps only tracked him hither to find my
own doom sealed; for I was defenceless.
</p>

<p>
Resolving to possess a weapon if it
could be found, I searched the whole hut,
which consisted of only two apartments,
but sought in vain.  Nor stick nor
bludgeon were there; so I armed myself with
one of the stools, which was certainly
better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
The window of the inner room, faced the
north-west, where a red light that
overspread the sky attracted my attention;
for if not some natural phenomenon, it
assuredly proceeded from the flames of a
vast conflagration.
</p>

<p>
I secured the door by its bar, lest I
should be taken by surprise, and seated
myself on a stool in a corner, with the
dog crouching at my feet.  But to rest
was impossible, amid the whirl of thought,
the mingled rage and grief that oppressed
me.  I felt as one in a burning fever.
</p>

<p>
There seemed to be under and about
me the ceaseless rush of water.  Was it
fancy?  The sound was too real for that;
and it seemed to proceed from a torrent or
waterfall at the back of the <i>chaumière</i>.  I
again entered the inner apartment, through
the dirty and broken lattice of which the
moon, shone clearly and brightly upon the
discoloured and ill-jointed boarding of the
floor.  No fall of water was visible
without, but the sound of it was louder now
than before.
</p>

<p>
A trap-door about three feet square
arrested my attention; and on raising it by
an iron ring in its centre, I felt my flesh
creep, when far down below, in darkness
and obscurity, I heard the distant rushing
of a vast torrent of water that flowed
unseen down the mountain side; and I
now knew that this trap-door&mdash;the
concealment of many a crime&mdash;was merely an
opening to the subterranean stream of
St. Aubin du Cormier, and that this
half-ruined chaumière had been built
immediately over one of the open
chasms&mdash;without a doubt for purposes dark and
nefarious.
</p>

<p>
I had scarcely let the trap-door drop
from my hand, when the bloodhound
started up with a snort, and uttered a low
growl.  Then I felt a wild fierce glow in
my heart, and a prickly sensation pass
over every limb, when, on looking from
the window, I beheld him for whom I
longed with a hate so intense and deadly;
he whom I had tracked thus far&mdash;he
who had on his hands the blood of
Jacqueline&mdash;he who had her sufferings and
death to atone for&mdash;was now plainly
visible as he passed through the screen of
wild bushes, and approached the hut!
</p>

<p>
The moonlight fell full upon his pale
and hideous visage&mdash;his black and matted
hair.  He was bareheaded, and had a pair
of long pistols and a knife in his belt,
while I was weaponless and weary; but
as I grasped one of the stools I felt, in
imagination, the strength of three men
pass into my poor right arm.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
THE STRUGGLE.
</h3>

<p>
The excitement, the ferocious joy of
anticipated vengeance, nearly suffocated me,
as, softly drawing back the bolt of the
door, I retired into a dark corner, from
whence I meant to spring upon him.
</p>

<p>
The latch was lifted, and he entered.
At that moment, as if stirred by an
invisible hand, the embers of the dying fire
shot into a flame that shed a red light
over all the squalid apartment, and thus
the wretch detected me in an instant.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sangbleu!</i>" he exclaimed, and started
back, more in wonder than fear.  "Who
are you? hah!" he added, as he recognised
me, and drawing forth a pistol, fired it
straight at my head; but happily the
ball struck the hard, thick wood of the
stool which I used as a shield, and
remained there.  The force of the shot,
however, made me reel; and as I was
rushing forward, he drew forth another,
but it flashed in the pan.  Then, to
prevent the use of his knife, I hurled the
stool at his head.  It struck him on the
right temple with such force as to stun
him for an instant, and deluged his face
with blood.
</p>

<p>
He was grasping vaguely at his girdle
for the haft of the knife which dandled
there, when I closed with him, seizing
his right arm; and then a deadly struggle
for life on one hand, and for life and
retribution on the other, ensued between us.
</p>

<p>
To know that I had in my grasp the
hand that had destroyed Jacqueline,
endued me with such savage energy that
for a time I was quite a match for the
Herculean ruffian with whom I fought.
I was lithe, active, and young, and my
dragoon drill with sword and club, had
developed every muscle to the utmost.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of Hautois was frightful!
His face was deathly pale, and streaked
with the blood that poured from the
wound on his temple; his thick black
hair was matted and in ell-locks; and his
yellow, bloodshot eyes glared into mine,
like those of a wolf, from beneath their
bushy brows, which met as one above his nose.
</p>

<p>
We never spoke as we swayed to and
fro, panting hoarsely, grasping each
other's wrists with a tiger-clutch, and
each making futile efforts to reach the
other's throat.  We heard only our deep
breathing, the ceaseless rush of the
stream, like a mill-race beneath the floor,
and the growling of the bloodhound,
which, by some means, had shut itself
into the inner apartment.
</p>

<p>
In this struggle, where each man
grasped the other with the fierce
compression of a smith's vice, it was evident
that whoever got the victory would yield
neither mercy nor quarter to the
vanquished.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a pang of terror chilled my
heart; for I found the muscular
Frenchman becoming stronger than myself,
either because he had husbanded his
powers, or that mine (so wearied by past
emotion, by grief, and the toil of the
preceding night) had departed; but he bent
me backward till I fell heavily prostrate
on the floor, with him above me, and in an
instant both his knees were on my chest.
</p>

<p>
As yet, his right hand had never
reached my throat, for my left was on
his wrist, and I held it from me at arm's
length.
</p>

<p>
Relinquishing the hold his left hand
had of me, he sought for the knife at
his girdle, but most fortunately, in our
struggle, our wrestling, writhing, and
swaying to and fro, it had dropped from
its sheath, and lay on the floor beyond
his reach, some yards off, else perhaps
these adventures had never been
committed to paper.
</p>

<p>
On discovering this, he uttered a
horrible malediction, and instantly plunged
his left hand on my throat.  Then a red
light seemed to flash from my eyes; I
felt as if the crown of my head was flying
off&mdash;there was a hissing and tingling in
my ears, and for some moments I
endured all the horror of strangulation,
till suddenly changing his mind, he exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sangbleu!</i> the trap-door&mdash;you shall
take a cold bath in the black Torrent du
Cormier, my fine fellow!"  And with a
yelling laugh he proceeded to drag me
across the floor of the room while yet
breathless and incapable of resistance.
</p>

<p>
He dashed open the door of the inner
apartment with his foot, and then with a
growl of long-suppressed fury the
bloodhound sprang upon him; rendered fiercer
by the blood which still flowed from the
wound in the head of Hautois, it grasped
him by the throat, snarling, worrying and
tearing, till dog and man fell down
together&mdash;the dog above, the man below.
</p>

<p>
Trembling with weakness and the overstrained
exertion of my recent struggle, I
rose and looked with stern exultation on
this new conflict, at this new and
unexpected ally, against whom the human
brute fought apparently in vain, for with
all his strength he failed to wrench or tear
the dog's sharp fangs from his already
lacerated throat.
</p>

<p>
At last, by the terror of approaching
death endued with twice his natural
strength, while uttering convulsive sobs
of agony, he rose to his full height, and
reeled about the apartment with the great
dog hanging at his throat and the chain
rattling at its collar; and what a face was
his, when for a moment a ray of moonlight
fell on it through the broken casement!
</p>

<p>
Hautois was reeling about close to the
trap-door, when an idea seized me.  I
threw it open, and gave him a push with
all my strength; and through the black
aperture, with a shriek and a growl the
man and dog vanished together.
</p>

<p>
I stood alone&mdash;alone, with no sound in
my ears save the rush of the subterranean
stream&mdash;the torrent of St. Aubin du
Cormier; how deep, how far down below,
coming from <i>whence</i> and flowing to <i>where</i>,
no man knew; but my teeth chattered,
and a shudder passed over me.
</p>

<p>
I let the trap-door drop to shut out the
horrid sound, and reeled giddily into the
outer apartment.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE CHAUMIÈRE.
</h3>

<p>
It was not until some minutes had elapsed
that I became fully conscious the fierce
struggle was over, and that Jacqueline
was avenged; but there lay on the floor
the pistols, the knife, and the blood of
him whose body was now whirling along
the chasms and amid the eddies of that
subterranean stream whose source and
outlet are alike unknown.
</p>

<p>
Tossing a stool upon the fire to feed
the sinking flame, and heedless of the
danger of being found in what was
doubtless the haunt, the abode of an
outlaw and robber, perhaps the
rendezvous of his partners in crime, I sank upon
the floor, to reflect and to rest.  It was
only then that I felt how weak, how
weary I was in body, how sick and ill at
heart.
</p>

<p>
I was trembling from head to foot, and
bathed in a cold perspiration; so much
had I undergone within the last four-and-twenty
hours that a kind of stupor came
upon me.
</p>

<p>
And Jacqueline&mdash;my soul was full of
her!  Her voice seemed ever in my
ear&mdash;her name upon my tongue&mdash;her image
before me.  The contour of her head,
with every soft feature and familiar
expression of eye; glances that were filled
with affection and susceptibility; her
smiling lip.  Ah, the pale mask which lay
at the foot of yonder tree in the
forest&mdash;could it be the face of her I loved so
well?
</p>

<p>
If I am to live, thought I, oh for the
whirl and excitement of war&mdash;a storm,
siege, wreck, battle, anything that will
lure me from myself and from thoughts
that are maddening.  To have loved
her and have lost her thus!  Every
pulsation was a pang, for I endured
all the keen misery of knowing that
I had been loved tenderly, truly,
and deeply in return, and yet had lost
her.
</p>

<p>
The images I drew of her endurance
and death, they indeed were too much
to think of long, so happily crushed by
my own reflections, overcome by toil, and
lulled by the ceaseless murmur of the
subterranean stream that poured beneath
the chaumière I fell asleep at last on the
hard floor where I lay.
</p>

<p>
I must have lain thus for some hours
when voices roused me, and I started up
to find that day had broken and several
men were about me.
</p>

<p>
I had a "splitting headache" (as
Charters used to say), a burning thirst,
and bloodshot eyes, the result of all I had
undergone; but on staggering up, I
recognised the Chevalier de Boisguiller,
Urbain the gardener, and Bertrand, with
several others, who followed the track
I had pursued, and who thus succeeded
in discovering the wretched chaumière
which had formed the lair of Hautois,
whom they clamorously inquired if I had
seen.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I; "and moreover I have
seen the last of him."
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;what has happened?" they
asked together, while the chevalier
added&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"These pistols and this knife lying
here&mdash;the blood on the floor, and the
broken stool, bear evidence of a conflict.
What has taken place?"
</p>

<p>
I briefly related all, and Boisguiller on
lifting the trap-door, gazed with a
shrinking aspect on the black torrent that
rushed far down below; and it would
appear that for dark purposes the
<i>chaumière</i> certainly had been built
immediately over one of the few open chasms
in the rocks, through which this torrent
of water traverses the forest of St. Aubin
du Cormier.
</p>

<p>
"Your vengeance has indeed been
ample&mdash;only perhaps too sudden," said
he, after a pause; "and now let us return,
but first, Urbain, we shall set fire to this
den, lest it find an occupant similar to the
last.  Then, monsieur, what are we to do
with you?"
</p>

<p>
"It matters little," said I, wearily, and
sick at heart.
</p>

<p>
"You are probably unaware that the
British have landed again, and set fire to
Cherbourg?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, chevalier!" I exclaimed,
interested in spite of myself, and
remembering that the blaze I had seen in the
sky to the north-west was now accounted
for.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; a strong force, we know not
how many, have disembarked at Bay des
Maries."
</p>

<p>
"Under the Duke of Marlborough?"
</p>

<p>
"No; the commander is a general
named Bligh."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardi! cet officier est un homme
d'expédition!</i>" muttered the old grenadier,
Bertrand; "he has already fired all the
coast."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and he is a man of courage and
daring, too," added the chevalier.  "<i>Peste!</i>
he shall not stay long in France, for all
that.  But we have no time to lose; our
sorrowful chase has come to an end, and
I must rejoin my troop, as all our forces
are closing towards Cherbourg to succour
the Comte de Raymond.  I repeat but
the words of my friend Madame de
Bourgneuf, when I say, monsieur, that I
wish you every success in life, now when
bidding you, it may be, farewell for ever.
But horses are here, and Bertrand the
porter, who has been an old soldier, shall
accompany you within sight of your
outposts at Cherbourg; so let us at once
be gone."
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that I was so faint that I
could scarcely reply, the chevalier kindly
said that if I wished to rejoin my
countrymen it was necessary to repair my
strength, so he insisted upon me imbibing
the contents of his flask, which were pure
cognac, and Urbain gave me from his
pouch a <i>galette</i> or pancake, made of
buckwheat and butter.
</p>

<p>
We separated soon after, and on looking
back from the road that led to Avranches,
old Bertrand and I saw a column of
smoke ascending into the clear blue sky
from the forest of St. Aubin du Cormier.
It was from the burning hut wherein I
had passed a night so terrible.
</p>

<p>
Riding at a quick pace we travelled
together the whole day, frequently passing
for miles through dense forests and
apple-orchards; but after leaving Coutances
behind, old Bertrand began to gnaw his
wiry moustache, to make grimaces and
mutter "<i>Sacré Dieu!</i>" "<i>Morbleu!</i>" and
so forth; for now the roads became covered
by people hastening inland with their
children and valuables, and by waggons
laden with furniture, sick and aged; the
panic being great in that corner of
Normandy; where the strength, object, and
ultimate end of the new British expedition
were quite unknown.
</p>

<p>
At last, after the sun had set, and the
moon arisen in splendour, we saw from
the heights, about seven miles off, the
town and fortifications of Cherbourg, with
the stately fleet of Commodore Howe
riding quietly at anchor in the bay, which
shone like a vast but rippling sheet of
silver, from Fort Querqueville on the
west, to the Isle Pelee on the east.
</p>

<p>
The way was clear before me now.  I
bade a kind farewell to Bertrand,
dismounted, and handing to him the bridle
of the chevalier's horse, walked hastily in
one direction, while he rode off in the
other.  Scarcely had we separated, when
a mounted patrol of ten dragoons in
scarlet cloaks, riding slowly, each with
carbine on thigh, came past.
</p>

<p>
"Who goes there?" challenged the
leader, in English.
</p>

<p>
"A friend!" I replied, mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"English, by Jove!" exclaimed the
officer in command, as the whole patrol
simultaneously checked their horses to
listen; "who or what are you, my man?"
</p>

<p>
"One of the Light Troop of the Scots
Greys, left wounded in the rear, after
the army abandoned Paramé," said I,
stepping forward and saluting.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds! and you have been in
France all this time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, since the beginning of June."
</p>

<p>
"All right," replied the officer, shortening
his reins; "remain with us.  We are
a party of the 11th Light Dragoons, and
shall pass you on to headquarters."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
THE LIGHT TROOP.
</h3>

<p>
I was welcomed back by the gallant
Captain Lindsay, by Lieutenant Douglas,
and Cornet Keith (the three officers of
the light troop), by old Sergeant Duff,
big Hob Elliot, and other comrades, with
a warmth that was very flattering; but
by none more than by Jack Charters and
honest Tom Kirkton, and among them
all, on the night of my return, rejoining,
or "resuscitation" as they phrased it,
there was held quite an ovation.
</p>

<p>
For two months my name had remained
on the muster-roll as "missing;" but
no doubt existed that I had been sabred
or shot in our affair with the French
hussars near Dol.
</p>

<p>
We had a jovial meeting, and the
pantries of the good wives of the adjacent
village supplied us amply with the means
of having a plentiful supper.  With ham,
bread, fowls, wine, and cognac we regaled
ourselves while lounging on the grass,
with the silver moon wading through
snowy clouds for a lamp and the
star-studded sky for a canopy.
</p>

<p>
In some instances, however, the
indiscriminate pillage of government stores
and abandoned dwelling-houses caused
several scenes of riot, disorder, and
debauchery, which neither patrols, the
picket, or guard of the Provost Marshal
could repress.
</p>

<p>
I was now in the best place to teach
me to forget the past.  The merry and
familiar voices, the gay uniforms, the
noble grey chargers picketed at their
breast ropes close by our bivouac, and
the <i>tout ensemble</i> of the latter, weaned
me from thoughts that were oppressive,
and the ardour of the service glowed anew
within me.
</p>

<p>
A narrative of my adventures in
Brittany was necessary, but I took care
to relate only such portions as I cared
to let those heedless fellows know; and
when I concluded, my green hunting
suit, with its Parisian cut and fashion,
afforded a subject for much merriment,
and for many empty jokes of that small
kind which will go a long way in the
barrack and guardroom.
</p>

<p>
I found Charters and Kirkton rather
more soured and reckless than when I
last saw them.  Both had expected
promotion to follow our first expedition to
France, and both still enjoyed their
respective ranks of full corporal and full
private; thus when we betook us to
rectifying the acidity of the Norman
wine by pure cognac they began to
moralize in their old fashion.
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" said Charters; "ten years
have I worn a red coat, and I am tiring
now even of it.  But every day that
passes into night is one march further
forward to the land of the leal where
we shall all meet at last; so pass the
bottle and let us be jolly while we may.
How, Gauntlet, you shake your head?
What the deuce has come over the boy!
France does not seem to have improved
him a bit."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Charters," said I, "but
remember that the troop parades an hour
before daybreak to-morrow, so no more
brandy.  Have we not had enough?"
</p>

<p>
"One bottle more, say I!"
</p>

<p>
"Zounds, Jack!" urged Kirkton, "if
you were not a very sponge you would
have been drowned in wine long ago."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Tom," said Charters, who was
rather tipsy, "don't be mutinous&mdash;I have
an idea&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What! after all this wine and brandy
you have actually an idea?  It must be
worth uncounted gold."
</p>

<p>
"It may be worth the king's commission,
Tom, or such a coffin as the pioneer's
shovel gives us," replied Charters, little
knowing how prophetically he spoke.
"We are to attack St. Vallon to-morrow,
and if the French have a standard in the
field, I will take it sword in hand&mdash;I,
John Charters of Amisfield&mdash;or die in
the attempt!"
</p>

<p>
And tipsy though he was, this unfortunate
fellow made the boast with a lofty
dignity that repressed the smile which
spread on Kirkton's face.  And now drums
beating and trumpets sounding in varying
cadence the tattoo, announced that sleep,
or at least silence, should reign in camp
and bivouac, till the commodore's ship in
the bay should fire the morning gun upon
the eventful morrow.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
CHARTERS' VOW.
</h3>

<p>
Sick, ill, without a horse or accoutrements,
I was now little better than a
non-effective, and thus happily, was only a
spectator of the destruction of Cherbourg.
I say happily, for France was the land of
Jacqueline, and I had not heart for the
work of pillage and destruction that
ensued around me.
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant-General Bligh, an old and
experienced officer, having succeeded to
the command of the troops, the squadron
had sailed from St. Helen's as before,
under the pennant of Commodore Howe,
who had on board the <i>Essex</i> his Royal
Highness Prince Edward (afterwards Duke
of York and Albany) who was serving as
a midshipman to learn the rudiments of
the sea-service for which he was destined,
and in which he died at an early age,
with the rank of Rear Admiral.
</p>

<p>
On the 7th August, the squadron, consisting
of five line-of-battle ships, nine
frigates, and ninety-eight transports, with
other craft, came to anchor in the bay of
Cherbourg, which is one of the five great
<i>ports militaires</i> of France, as the general
had special orders to destroy the whole
place.
</p>

<p>
By this time a body of French troops
of the line, in bright blue uniforms, with
some companies of the Irish Brigade clad
in scarlet, had intrenched themselves in a
line which extended for four miles along
the coast, from Fort Ecourdeville to two
miles beyond Cherbourg, and these hasty
defences they strengthened by redoubts
mounted with cannon, most of which were
twenty-four pounders.
</p>

<p>
In rear of this line were some corps of
cavalry.
</p>

<p>
While Commodore Howe sent a bomb-ketch
to anchor close off the town, with
orders to pitch a few shells into it from
time to time, and thus amuse or decoy
the officer in command there, the British
forces landed three miles westward of
Querqueville, the most western fort of the
bay.  During the disembarkation several
other bomb-ketches shelled the line of
intrenchments not only with explosives
of the usual kind, but from mortars loaded
with musket balls, thus making great
slaughter with little or no risk to us.
</p>

<p>
As on the former occasion the flat-bottomed
boats were hoisted out, and the
three regiments of guards, with the
grenadier company of every battalion on board
the fleet, were first rowed ashore, and
formed in line upon a portion of the beach
that was flat and open.  Each boat
contained eighteen seamen and fifty
grenadiers, and had a red flag displayed at its
stern.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the landing place opened a
grassy hollow, with a pretty village that
crowned a steep eminence on the right
flank; on the left were thick green
hedges enclosing orchards laden with fruit
of the most brilliant yellow and crimson
colours, and amid these were seen the
serried files and glittering bayonets of the
enemy.
</p>

<p>
This was a beautiful evening, when the
summer sun of Normandy covered all the
fertile land and rippling sea with warm
light, and bathed in purple tints the
undulating ridges of the Mont-du-Roule and
of the Boc-au-chat, while the waves that
washed the sloping bastions of Cherbourg,
of Fort Royal, and those on the Isle Pelee,
or those that broke in foam on the rocks
of St. Anne, seemed billows of liquid gold.
</p>

<p>
Puff&mdash;puff&mdash;puff&mdash;came the white
smoke out from the green hedgerows and
glowing orchards, as the foe opened a
running fire of musketry, under which
our grenadiers and Guards formed line,
and rushing forward with fixed bayonets
and a hearty hurrah, drove in the French
out-pickets and stormed a breast-work
that lay across the hollow way beyond
the beach.
</p>

<p>
So rapid was the advance, that in this
encounter there were only three privates
killed and seventeen wounded; while <i>three
hundred</i> of the enemy were killed or
wounded, and among the former was a
Captain Macartney of the Irish Brigade,
in whose pocket Hob Elliot of ours,
"found a letter," as the newspapers stated,
"from a lady in London, dated on the
30th ultimo, assuring him that we were
about to pay France a visit, and giving a
particular account of our strength."
</p>

<p>
General Bligh took possession of the
village of Erville, where several Irish
deserters came in to him with assurances
that a great force was coming against
the British; but he declared that "if
twenty thousand came he would not retire
until Cherbourg was in ruins!"  Having
thus succeeded in turning the western
flank of this famous port, he encamped
under canvas his whole force, which
consisted only of three battalions of the
Guards, the 5th, 30th, 33rd, 34th, 56th,
67th and 68th regiments of Foot with those
of Richmond and Cornwallis; the Light
Troop of the Greys and of five other corps,
making, with the artillery, in all about
ten thousand men.
</p>

<p>
The night at Erville was lovely, the
air serene and soft.  Groves of the wild
mulberry bordered the camp, and others
of orange and apple trees loaded the night
wind with perfume.  The stars shone
clear in heaven, and the sky was blue
and bright from its zenith to the far
horizon; but amid that calm scene there
lay many a stiffened corpse and gaping
wound in the hollow way through which
the foe had been routed.
</p>

<p>
Lord Clare's Irish regiment, 700 strong,
occupied Cherbourg, and the Count de
Raymond, a Maréchal de Camp, who commanded
in chief, had also under his orders
Count Horions' new Regiment de Liege,
with the old battalions of Lorraine,
Languedoc and Guienne; in all, with
militia, a force of about fourteen thousand
men, was close at hand, so a bloody resistance
was anticipated by our troops upon
the morrow.
</p>

<p>
The morrow came, and before daybreak
the whole army was under arms, and
advancing, with the light dragoons in
front, towards Cherbourg, with drums
beating and colours flying.
</p>

<p>
Some daring French artillerymen, who
had been left in the solitary fort of
Querqueville, now opened a dangerous fire
from a few pieces of cannon as our troops
advanced.  This seemed to serve as a
signal to their comrades, who immediately
abandoned Cherbourg <i>en masse</i>, and without
exchanging a shot retired to a place
named St. Vallon, nine miles distant.
</p>

<p>
The guns in Querqueville were still
firing briskly, when a boat from the
Commodore's ship was seen pulling inshore to
the westward of the battery.
</p>

<p>
A dragoon being required to bear an
order to the officer in charge of this boat,
a volunteer was requested for the duty,
which was one of great risk, as the grape
from Querqueville was sweeping all the
open plateau to be traversed by the
messenger.
</p>

<p>
On this, Charters immediately rode
forward, "recovered" his sword and
presented himself.
</p>

<p>
"Why have <i>you</i> volunteered for this?"
asked Captain Lindsay, in a tone of reproof.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir?" repeated Charters, almost
haughtily.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Because, as the player says&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I am a man<br />
  So weary with disaster, tugged by fortune,<br />
  That I would set my life on any chance,<br />
  To mend it or be rid on't'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Captain Lindsay, life is no longer a
prism to me."
</p>

<p>
"Ride fast!" said the captain, briefly.
</p>

<p>
Charters shortened his reins, gave his
grey the spurs, and departed at once.
As he proceeded towards Querqueville
Point, the French cannoniers redoubled
their efforts to bring him down.  He
frequently waved his sword as if in
defiance, and escaped as if by a miracle.
Then on his descending to the beach,
where some rocks protected him, the
battery turned its round shot and grape on
the advancing boat.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there rose from the sea and
pierced the sky, the mingled yell of many
voices.  A twenty-four pound shot had
dashed the boat to pieces, and twelve
seamen and a little midshipman were seen
struggling and sinking amid the debris of
oars, thwarts and planks, while the French
sent dose after dose of grape to kill the
drowning men.
</p>

<p>
The middy struggled bravely; being
light, the waves bore him towards the
rocks, but Charters saw that unless
succoured, the poor lad would certainly
perish amid the surf that boiled over the
ridge.
</p>

<p>
He sheathed his sword, shook his
gloved hand fiercely at the battery, and
urging his horse into the sea, even while
the hissing grape sowed it thick with tiny
waterspouts around him, succeeded in
grasping the sinking lad by the collar,
and turning the head of his gallant grey
toward the shore, he bravely battled with
the surf, the long waves of which,
reddened by the sunshine, seemed to boil in
fiery foam upon the beach, and rolled over
his shoulders, so that at times the nostrils
of his charger were only visible, yet he
succeeded in landing the half-drowned
midshipman, and rode twice afterwards
into the sea to succour the seamen, but
succeeded in saving only one.
</p>

<p>
This was done in the presence of the
whole left wing of the army, which gave
him three tremendous cheers, and a few
minutes afterwards the grenadiers of
Richmond's corps with the light troop
of the Greys made a dash at the fort,
which immediately surrendered.
</p>

<p>
As the troops advanced into Cherbourg
the French flag was pulled down, and the
Union Jack hoisted on the ramparts by
the people in token of capitulation, and
ere long, the magistrates in their robes
and insignia of office came forth from the
gates towards the land side to meet
General Bligh, who promised that save
government stores which he had special
orders to destroy, all property should be
respected.  Thus, by three in the afternoon
our troops had peaceable possession
of the town and forts of boasted Cherbourg.
</p>

<p>
In the evening, the Greys, a troop of
the 11th and a body of grenadiers were
pushed on towards St. Vallon, from whence
a party of French Horse, the hussars of
Boisguiller, with the heavy dragoons of
Languedoc <i>checquered</i>, had advanced to
reconnoitre or to skirmish.
</p>

<p>
As our light dragoons moved off, the
aide-de-camp of the commander-in-chief
rode up to the troop of ours and
addressing Charters, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You did three acts of great bravery
to-day under the fire of Fort Querqueville,
but chiefly in saving the life of that
midshipman."
</p>

<p>
"Sir," replied Jack, nonchalantly, "I
only did the duty dictated by common
humanity; and I hope the little mid has
dried his jacket by this time."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the name of him you
saved?"
</p>

<p>
"Not I&mdash;never thought of such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;that little middy was his Royal
Highness Prince Edward, the second son
of the king; and I have it in command
from Lieutenant-General Bligh to compliment
you, Corporal Charters, and to say
that you shall have the <i>first</i> pair of colours
that become vacant in the force now under
his orders."
</p>

<p>
The nut-brown cheek of Charters
flushed, as he replied in voice rendered
husky by emotion&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It is well, sir, and I thank the general.
I have saved the lives of men ere now;
but they were merely private soldiers, <i>not</i>
royal highnesses, so my humanity or
bravery went for little."
</p>

<p>
"Charters, this bitterness and pride are
your ruin," said the aide-de-camp, who
knew well the story of our comrade.
</p>

<p>
"Not so; tell General Bligh that I am
not ungrateful, and that I shall thank him
from my soul, if, before I die, he replace
upon my shoulders those epaulettes of
which they should never have been deprived!"
</p>

<p>
"He will, Charters, and I shall be one
of the first to welcome you and to wet the
new commission," replied the frank staff
officer.  "Captain Lindsay, you had better
form the two troops in squadron, and
make a dash at those advancing cavalry,
as the ground is open here."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, while this conversation had
been proceeding, the French hussars and
heavy dragoons, about one hundred and
eighty in all, had debouched from some
hedgerows upon a piece of open moorland,
with a swallow-tailed banner of light blue
silk flying in their centre.
</p>

<p>
Charters pointed to it with his sword,
and said to Kirkton&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You see yonder standard, Tom?
Well&mdash;I shall fulfil my vow of last night,
or my horse shall go home with an empty
saddle!"
</p>

<p>
Quietly and orderly as if upon parade
in Hyde Park, the two troops formed
squadron; Captain Lindsay equalized them,
appointed the troop leaders and the
serrefiles; he then took post half a horse's
length in front of the standard, which was
borne by troop sergeant-major Duff, and
which was of scarlet silk embroidered with
the thistle and St. Andrew, the regimental
motto, and the national one, <i>Nemo
me impune lacessit</i>.
</p>

<p>
I shall not attempt to describe the fury
of the encounter that took place, as I was
not present.  It was long, desperate, and
hand to hand.  Charters unhorsed the
cornet and captured the standard which
belonged to the Languedoc dragoons, who
made a desperate rally to recover it, and
cut him off.  For some minutes he and
big Hob Elliot were fairly surrounded by
the enemy, but Captain Lindsay made a
gallant charge to save him, as he was a
prime favourite with the corps.  In that
charge the captain perished, but the
French were repulsed.*
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* "Several skirmishes were fought by the
out-parties of each army, in one of which, Captain
Lindsay, a gallant officer (of the Greys), who had
been very instrumental in training the Light
Horse, perished."  Smollet, <i>Hist. of Eng.</i>, vol. vi.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The squadron was brought out of the
field by Lieutenant Douglas of ours, and
it was with a sad heart I saw them enter
Cherbourg, bearing across their saddles
the wounded and the dead.
</p>

<p>
Among the latter was my poor friend
Charters, slain by three pistol-shots and
eight sabre wounds, yet still grasping
with a deadly clutch the standard of the
dragoons of Languedoc.
</p>

<p>
Hob Elliot carried his body out of the
field.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE SACK OF CHERBOURG.
</h3>

<p>
During the reign of Louis XIV. plans had
been proposed by the celebrated Marshal
Vauban, for the fortification of
Cherbourg; these were then only partially
carried into effect, but a noble and spacious
harbour had subsequently been formed.
Two piers, one a thousand, the other five
hundred, feet in length, had been built,
and outer and inner basins were made
large enough to contain ships of the line;
these basins were closed by gates each
forty-two feet wide.
</p>

<p>
To destroy these, General Bligh had
fifteen hundred soldiers at work making
blasts, and so well did they prosecute the
art of destruction, that the labour of
thirty years, and the expense of one
million two hundred thousand pounds
(English) perished in a few days.  In
short, the noble harbour of Cherbourg was
utterly ruined, and the shipping it
contained was given to the flames.
</p>

<p>
We took twenty-four tons of gunpowder
out of the French magazines, and blew up
or threw down all the bastions and batteries
along the shore, from Fort Querqueville to
the Isle Pelee, and dismounted, or flung
into the sea, one hundred and sixty-three
pieces of cannon and three mortars, with
a vast quantity of shot and shell.  Two
mortars and twenty-two beautiful guns,
all of polished brass, together with several
colours (among them, of course, the
standard taken by poor Jack Charters),
were put on board the commodore's ship.
</p>

<p>
On the side of one of the great
sluice-gates I saw an inscription in French to
the following effect:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Louis and Fleury trust to Asfield's care,<br />
  Amid the waves to raise this mighty pier,<br />
  Propitious to our prayers the fabric stood,<br />
  Curbed the fierce tide, and tamed the threatening flood,<br />
  Hence wealth and safety flow&mdash;hence just renown,<br />
  The king, the statesman, and the hero crown!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work, by command of Louis XV.<br />
  The advice of Cardinal Fleury, and direction of Count Asfield,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall endure for ever!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Scarcely had I finished reading this, than
an officer of our regiment called to me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hallo! look out! stand back there!"
</p>

<p>
He had a match in his hand, which he
applied to a train, and in one minute the
whole fabric, with a tremendous concussion,
rent, split, rose into the air amid a cloud
of smoke, and vanished as it sank into the
surf that boiled over it.
</p>

<p>
Two armed ships which lay in the inner
basin we despatched to England, and
eighteen others we burned or sunk filled
with stones.  On the people of Cherbourg
a contribution of forty-four thousand livres
was levied by beat of drum; and so rapidly
did our miners and devastators do their
work, that the whole place was a scene of
melancholy ruin and desolation before the
Count de Raymond could muster forces of
the line sufficient to dislodge us, for France
had then two armies in Germany.
</p>

<p>
Thus, all our troops were on board, and
the whole armament ready for sea by the
17th of August; our total loss, after having
destroyed, what was styled in the prints
of the day, "that most galling thorn in
the side of British commerce," being only
Captain Lindsay of the Scots Greys, and
twenty-four others killed, some thirty
wounded, and ten horses.
</p>

<p>
The whole army re-embarked without
molestation at Fort Galette, about three
o'clock in the morning.
</p>

<p>
The commodore, who had now, by the
death of his brother, who fell at the head
of the 55th Regiment in the disastrous
affair of Ticonderoga, succeeded to the
title of Viscount Howe, gave the signal
for sea, and we sailed on the evening of
the 17th for England.  I was again on
board his ship with the light troop of my
regiment.
</p>

<p>
The destruction I had witnessed, and
the distress and alarm of the poor
unoffending people, sickened me of war for
a time, and I felt happy when we bore up
the Channel, though still haunted by
memories of the land of Brittany, on
which I should never look again&mdash;a land
of stern and dreary mountains, of dark
primæval forests, of rocky bluffs, of ruined
castles and giant monoliths&mdash;the land
where I loved so tenderly and endured so
terribly.
</p>

<p>
On the 19th I saw Old England again,
and the whole fleet came to anchor in
Portland Roads.
</p>

<p>
The colours and brass guns taken at
Cherbourg, after being exhibited to gaping
multitudes in Hyde Park, were drawn in
triumph through all the principal streets
of London, as the spoil of conquered
France, amid a noisy pomp that brought
ridicule on the ministry.  After this they
were lodged in the Tower.
</p>

<p>
Instead of being sent home to Scotland,
as we had fondly speculated, the light
troop of the Scots Greys now marched
through Dorsetshire and Hampshire into
Sussex, where we reached the head-quarters
of the regiment, then under orders to join
the army in Germany.
</p>

<p>
Our fine old colonel&mdash;"auld Geordie
Buffcoat," as the corps named him&mdash;complimented
the troop for its uniform good
conduct during the two expeditions to the
coast of France, and hoped that when on
the Rhine we should still prove ourselves
"to be his own brave lads, who were
<i>second to none</i>!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
WHAT THE GAZETTE CONTAINED.
</h3>

<p>
I had now served one campaign, though
a short one; had seen the conclusion of
another, ending in the total destruction of
Cherbourg, and was on the eve of
commencing a third, and yet found myself,
despite all my day-dreams and lofty
aspirations, unnoticed and unknown.  I
was graver now than before.  It seemed
to me that I had seen much of the world,
and assuredly I had suffered much in the
time that had elapsed between our landing
at Cancalle Bay and the re-embarkation at
Fort Galette.
</p>

<p>
We were now at Wadhurst, a secluded
place in Sussex.  On the morning after we
joined, Colonel Preston sent for me to the
orderly-room, where there ensued a
conversation which caused some speculation in
the regiment, where my incognito was still
preserved.  The secret of who I was, or
what I should have been, was now known
to Kirkton only, for poor Jack Charters,
as I have already said, was in his soldier's
grave among the ruins of Cherbourg, and
the only relic I possessed of him was a
pair of sleeve-links.
</p>

<p>
The bluff old colonel was standing with
his spurred heels planted firmly on the
hearthrug, and his hands behind his
back, which was opposed to the fireplace,
in the true orderly-room fashion, and he
gave me a friendly nod as I entered.
</p>

<p>
"You are aware, of course, Gauntlet,"
said he, "that money to purchase a
cornetcy has been lodged for you."
</p>

<p>
"With whom, sir?" I asked, in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"The regimental agents, Messrs. Cox
and Mair, of Craig's Court, London."
</p>

<p>
"By whom, colonel?"
</p>

<p>
"Your friends&mdash;you should know best."
</p>

<p>
"I have no friends&mdash;never had any,"
said I, bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"It was lodged two months since,"
resumed the colonel, "and gazetted you
would have been ere this, but for our
doubt about your fate, poor Captain
Lindsay having sent your name to the
War Office as <i>missing</i>."
</p>

<p>
I stood looking at the grave, kind, and
soldierly old man with a stupified air.
</p>

<p>
My cousin Aurora must have done
this&mdash;I was certain of it&mdash;for no one
else in all the world knew of me, or cared
for me; but I was too proud to accept of
this donation even from her&mdash;from the
usurper of my patrimony, for such I
deemed her&mdash;and urged the colonel to
write at once to the regimental agents,
desiring them to return the money to the
depositor thereof, whoever he or she
might he.
</p>

<p>
I said this so haughtily, so bitterly,
and peremptorily, and with such a flush on
my cheek, that the adjutant and orderly-room
clerks, who were fussing among
docquets of papers and returns, looked
up with surprise, and the old colonel,
after carefully wiping a great pair of
spectacles, put them on his copper-coloured
nose, and surveyed me from head to foot
with extreme coolness and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
"Zounds!  Gauntlet," said he, "you are
a very extraordinary fellow&mdash;very!  Have
you no wish to rise in the service?"
</p>

<p>
"By my own merit, sir, I have every
wish, but not by the money&mdash;(of others, I
was about to say, but added)&mdash;the money
that should have been mine."
</p>

<p>
"Should&mdash;hum."
</p>

<p>
"I shall go to Germany with you,
Colonel Preston, as a private trooper, and
I care little if I never come back again."
</p>

<p>
"And you positively refuse this commission?"
</p>

<p>
"From an unknown donor, yes, colonel."
</p>

<p>
"Well, 'tis puzzling, but you know
your own affairs best.  I have the
reputation of being the most eccentric old
fellow in the service; henceforth you shall
enjoy the reputation of being the most
eccentric young one."
</p>

<p>
Old Preston gave me a kind of nod, as
if to intimate that the interview was over,
and resumed a conference with the farrier-sergeant
concerning the re-shoeing of all
the horses prior to embarkation, while I
strolled forth into the barrack-yard to
ponder over what had passed.
</p>

<p>
The news of this interview rapidly
spread, and I was speedily joined by Tom
Kirkton.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "I like your
spirit, Gauntlet; yet this seems to
me&mdash;and it would have seemed to poor Jack,
had he been here&mdash;the very acme of
petulance and folly."
</p>

<p>
Selfishness and ambition struggled
with pride.  I was silent, for it seemed to
me that never again might such a chance
of being raised to my proper position occur
to me, and already I half repented having
scorned or refused the proffered gift,
without inquiry.  It was not too late to
retract!  I made one pace towards the
orderly-room, but pride resumed its power,
and I turned away.
</p>

<p>
"It must be the act of my cousin,
Aurora Gauntlet," said I, "for I have not
a relative on earth that I know of, Tom,
but her."
</p>

<p>
"Does it not occur to you, most sapient
sir, that your cousin might find it easier
and more convenient to forget you&mdash;to
ignore rather than to remember you, and
do her utmost to be your friend?"
</p>

<p>
"True, Tom, but you cannot feel as I
feel in this matter."
</p>

<p>
"And then, of course, it is not every
dragoon who carries in his valise a diploma
of baronetcy."
</p>

<p>
"These last words of yours, Kirkton,
have cured me even of regret," said I,
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
"Then I am sorry that they passed my
lips.  'Oons man, why not make love to
her?&mdash;there are worse matches in this
world than a young and handsome cousin."
</p>

<p>
These words provoked only an angry
smile, and the trumpet sounding for stable
duty cut short the interview by hurrying
us to look after the wants of our respective
steeds.
</p>

<p>
So, according to my desire, Colonel
Preston wrote to the agents, and the
money was returned; but in the next
War Office Gazette how great was the
surprise of my comrades and myself
when we read the following announcement&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Scots Greys, Light Troop</i>.&mdash;Lieut. Sholto
Douglas to be captain, <i>vice</i> Lindsay,
killed in action; Cornet James Keith
to be Lieut., <i>vice</i> Douglas, promoted; Sir
Basil Gauntlet, Bart., to be cornet, <i>vice</i>
Keith."
</p>

<p>
"Sir Basil Gauntlet, <i>Baronet</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Had a loaded bomb of the greatest size
exploded in the centre of the mess-room
table it could scarcely have created so
much speculation as this remarkable
gazette did among the officers of his
Majesty's Second Dragoons, of whom I
thus found myself one.
</p>

<p>
Could I doubt that Aurora had done
this?  Could I be less than grateful that
she&mdash;the only being who inherited the
same name and blood, was determined not
to forget me?  Thus, finding that in my
stubborn pride I declined the cornetcy by
purchase, without further consultation she
had resolved to drag me into my place by
a commission without it.
</p>

<p>
As yet I knew not all this with
certainty, and was too proud to write to
Netherwood Hall; moreover, I knew not
whether Aurora was there, though had I
considered, the celerity with which the
whole affair had been transacted should
have convinced me that she was in the
metropolis.
</p>

<p>
And thus I was an officer, an officer at
last, and without having performed even
the smallest of those superhuman acts of
heroism of which I had drawn such
dashing pictures in my day-dreams; without
capturing standards sword-in-hand,
without leading on furious charges, or
disastrous forlorn hopes; made an officer simply
through a note, written by a pretty girl's
hand to some official source.
</p>

<p>
Thus was I promoted; my comrades
congratulated me, and I felt a joyous
certainty that their emotions were sincere,
even those of the old grumblers and the
"knowing ones," who at the outset of his
career had fleeced poor Basil the recruit
of his bounty at the Canteen and tavern.
</p>

<p>
The day of embarkation for Germany
had not been named, but it was known to
be drawing near: thus, with the extremely
limited means at my disposal I had little
else to think of than providing myself
with a horse in addition to my trooper
uniform and other <i>et cetera</i> befitting my
rank.  Those friendly and fatherly
gentlemen of the race of Judah who hang
about all barracks as the carrion crow and
vulture in mid-air overhang a battle-field,
were at hand to aid me for a "moderate
consideration" in the way of thirty or forty
per cent. interest, and the whole affair
was soon done&mdash;all the sooner that old
Colonel Preston was my friend.
</p>

<p>
In a <i>week</i> after my appointment (the
rules of the service were not then what
they were afterwards) I found myself on
duty as an officer, and oddly enough it
was that of a <i>marine</i> on board a frigate.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
THE PRISON SHIP.
</h3>

<p>
A thirty-six gun frigate, the <i>Alceste</i>,
crowded with French prisoners, had for
some reason, I know not what, come into
the old harbour of Rye, which was then
becoming rapidly choked up with sand,
and unfortunately she became, as the
sailors term it, <i>neaped</i>, which means being
left so far aground by the neap-tide, which
there rises to the height of seventeen feet,
that there was no chance of her floating
even at high-water, until the spring-tide
flowed again.
</p>

<p>
In this state she lay imbedded in the
sand, and careened over to port, much to
the discomfort of those on board.
</p>

<p>
Several brawls having ensued among
the prisoners, as the marine guard had
been withdrawn (to partake in a third,
and, as it proved in the sequel, most
disastrous expedition to the coast of
France), the officer in command applied
for a guard of dismounted dragoons, the
Greys being the nearest troops at hand;
and thus with twenty men of the light
troop I found myself doing marine duty
on board H.M. ship <i>Alceste</i>.
</p>

<p>
In her commander I recognised one of
the junior officers of Lord Howe's ship, a
young lieutenant, for the frigate had
all her guns out save two, and was simply
degraded to the rank of a floating prison.
He welcomed me all the more warmly
that he was a countryman of mine, and
one who spoke his native dialect in all its
Doric breadth and native purity.  He was
afterwards that Captain I&mdash;&mdash; who
commanded the <i>Belliqueux</i>, 64, at Camperdown,
and who in the beginning of the action,
on failing to make out Lord Duncan's
signals amid the smoke, after various
attempts flung the signal book on deck,
and shouted from the poop&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Up wi' yer helm, damme, and gang
doon into the middle o't!"  Then running
in between two of the enemy's ships he
shortened sail, and engaged his guns on
both sides at once.
</p>

<p>
Now lest the reader may never have
seen a hulk crowded with French prisoners,
I shall sketch briefly a little of what we
saw on board of the <i>Alceste</i>.
</p>

<p>
A few seamen and petty officers composed
her crew, and she had on board, and
under their care, four hundred desperadoes,
as she was the condemned ship of the
larger hulks which lay moored in
Portsmouth harbour and elsewhere, being the
receptacle for those prisoners whose
misconduct, desperate character, or violent
disposition rendered them obnoxious to
rule and to the rest of their comrades.
</p>

<p>
Each of these prisoners when brought
on board was provided with a suit of
yellow uniform, this colour being deemed
sufficiently remarkable to ensure notice
and recapture in case of escape being
effected.  Each had also a hammock and
bedding.  To cook their rations certain
men were elected by themselves, and the
sole duty imposed upon the general body
was the simple task of keeping themselves
clean, the space they occupied between
decks neat and tidy, and of bringing up
their hammocks daily to air in the
nettings.
</p>

<p>
Soldiers or seamen with loaded muskets
were posted at various parts of the vessel,
and in the poop cabins were two
twenty-four pounders kept loaded; and these, in
case of revolt or disturbance could be
run through ports in the bulkhead, to
sweep the decks with grape and canister
shot.
</p>

<p>
On the main deck was a railed space
named the <i>pound</i>, wherein the prisoners
were allowed to walk and amuse
themselves during the day; and there they
were at liberty to expose for sale those
boxes of dominoes, toy ships, buttons,
bodkins, and other trifles, which, with
the native ingenuity of their country,
French prisoners were wont to manufacture
from their ration bones and pieces of
wood given to them by the ship carpenter.
</p>

<p>
But from the character of our prisoners&mdash;the
refuse of the other prison hulks&mdash;I
found few such traces of industry on board
the <i>Alceste</i>.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of the absence of the
marines, the discomfort of the ship while
lying careened to port, and her vicinity
to the land, Lieutenant I&mdash;&mdash; soon found
the prisoners in a furious state of
discontent, and beginning to encourage hopes
of breaking loose by cutting a hole in the
ship's side with a knife.
</p>

<p>
The ringleaders he had punished
according to his printed regulations; but
ten days in the black hole, among rats
and bilge-water, extra deck-cleaning duty,
and short allowance of hard biscuits and
stale "swipes," utterly failed to repress
their turbulence and insubordination.
</p>

<p>
There were sailors, soldiers, privateersmen,
merchant-seamen, civilians, and even
officers who had broken their parole,
crammed together in wretchedness and
filth, some of them being almost in a
state of nudity, with nothing more than
a piece of old sail tied round them,
notwithstanding all the excellent regulations
of the Transport Board, and the exertions
of the officers and slender crew of the
<i>Alceste</i>, for most of these Frenchmen were
now so desperate and degraded that they
cared less for death than life.  Thus,
never shall I forget the impression made
upon me when I looked along the far
vista of the lower deck, when the flakes
of yellow sunlight were streaming across
it through the barred gratings of the
triced-up ports, and saw the tattered
figures, the scrubby beards, the scarred
forms&mdash;scarred less in battle than by
prison brawls (for some who were
obnoxious to the rest were horribly
mutilated)&mdash;the shock heads of black, uncombed
hair, the unwashed visages and bloodshot
eyes of those prisoners&mdash;the dull apathy
of some, the ferocious hate exhibited by
others; and when I heard the yells,
screams, obscenity and mockery with
which they greeted us as new comers,
and chiefly when my guard, as a hint,
deliberately loaded their carbines with
ball-cartridge before them.
</p>

<p>
"From what do all these miseries and
disorders arise?" I asked, as we retired
and entered the great cabin, the windows
of which faced to the coast of Kent.
</p>

<p>
"You may well inquire," replied Lieutenant
I&mdash;&mdash;; "they have their origin in
an inordinate passion for gambling."
</p>

<p>
"Gambling?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; you would be astonished,"
continued the lieutenant, whose dialect I
render in English, "if you knew how
these incorrigible wretches persevere in a
vice that ends in the death of many and
the misery of all.  Their clothes, their
beds, their rations, the hair of their heads,
and their very teeth, they convert into
objects on which to hazard the turn of a
card or a cast of the dice.  For months
in advance many of them have lost all
their food to more fortunate or more
knavish gamblers; and so hard of heart
have some of these become, that they will
see their victims perish of hunger before
their eyes without bestowing a morsel to
alleviate their sufferings.  Many have
died on the lower deck, naked, of cold in
the winter, and others of sheer starvation.
In the stomachs of two, who were thus
found dead in the cable-tier yesterday,
our surgeon found only a little water.  I
have had small-arm men posted over the
mess-tables with loaded pistols, to force
each man to eat his own rations, whether
gambled away or not; and all night long
we have to watch every portion of the
ship, as they are for ever cutting holes in
her sheathing with knives they have
secreted&mdash;holes for the purpose of escaping
or of scuttling her with all on board.
So, sir," he added, with an oath, "you
are likely to find yourself in pleasant
company."
</p>

<p>
It would seem that on finding the ship
stranded in Rye Harbour, and so near the
shore, a privateersman, notorious as a
ringleader in every disorder, cut, with the
help of a knife&mdash;the edge of which he had
serrated as a saw&mdash;one of those holes to
which my friend referred, on the starboard
side and just amidships.
</p>

<p>
This had been discovered in time, and
in accordance with standing orders every
prisoner in that part of the ship had been
put upon half-rations to defray the
expense of the repair, which the carpenter
stated at twenty-five pounds sterling.
</p>

<p>
A dreadful uproar ensued when this
information was communicated to the
Frenchmen.  Wet swabs, holystones,
belaying-pins, pieces of wood torn from the
hatch way-combings and deck-gratings,
mops, brooms, and everything available as
a weapon, were in immediate requisition;
and the prisoners broke into open revolt
on the third day after we were on board.
</p>

<p>
The drum beat to arms, the crew drove
below all who were in the pound, battened
down the hatches, and promptly ran the
two twenty-four pounders through the
bulkhead aft to sweep the deck forward if
necessary; but so much was the vessel
careened over in the sand that the guns
failed to work well.  Thus my twenty
dismounted Greys, with their carbines
loaded, were formed in line across the
deck, ready for whatever might ensue;
Lieutenant I&mdash;&mdash; having of course
command of the whole.
</p>

<p>
As the disorder was at its height, and
several missiles had been flung at us, I
gave the orders&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ready&mdash;present!" but on finding that
the din was instantly hushed, I added,
"<i>Advance</i> arms!"
</p>

<p>
Stepping forward a few paces, and
taking advantage of the lull, I was
proceeding to address the prisoners in the
most conciliatory terms, when the
privateersman&mdash;a tall, strong, and swarthy
fellow from Martinique&mdash;with silver rings
in his ears, and naked to the waist, rushed
upon me with a knife, in eluding which I
stumbled and fell.
</p>

<p>
On seeing this, believing me to be
stabbed, Tom Kirkton cried&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Let us shoot them down&mdash;fire!"
</p>

<p>
Then a volley of carbines was poured
in.  This shot the privateersman and
another dead, and severely wounded ten
more.  A terrible scene then took place
at the hatchways, as the fugitives scrambled,
tumbled, and rolled over each other&mdash;falling
through in heaps in their haste
to escape to the lower hold, cockpit,
cable-tier, or anywhere; all save those who lay
on the deck, and one, a many in tattered
uniform, who stood calmly with arms
folded, and with his back to the mainmast,
eyeing us with steady disdain, as if
waiting for the next platoon.
</p>

<p>
With my sword drawn, I stepped forward
to question this rash man, and then
judge my emotion on recognising in him
the&mdash;Chevalier de Boisguiller!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
"TRUTH IS STRANGER THAN FICTION."
</h3>

<p>
"Fire&mdash;kill me!" exclaimed the chevalier,
proudly and fiercely; "I have no desire
to live after the degradation to which you
have subjected me&mdash;I, an officer of the
Queen's Hussars, and a chevalier of the
order.  <i>Ah, sacré!</i> perfidious English&mdash;you
know not how to make war."
</p>

<p>
"Monsieur de Boisguiller, have you
already forgot me&mdash;and our meetings in
the chateau of Bourgneuf, and the forest
of St. Aubin du Cormier?"
</p>

<p>
His expression changed on recognising
me; but perceiving my epaulettes, gorget,
and sash&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pardieu!</i>" he exclaimed, with a
grimace on his lip, and fire flashing in
his eyes; "we seem to have changed
places with a vengeance, Monsieur l'Ecossais!"
</p>

<p>
He said something more, but his voice
was rendered incoherent by the shame and
passion, pride and mortification, which
almost made him weep.
</p>

<p>
I turned to Lieutenant I&mdash;&mdash;, of the
<i>Alceste</i>, and inquired how it came to pass
that the chevalier, whom I knew to be a
brave and honourable French officer, should
be found in a plight so deplorable, and
thrust among such associates.
</p>

<p>
"He was sent on board here for
attempting to kill the captain of one of
our privateers," replied the naval officer
briefly, and with a contemptuous glance
at the Frenchman.
</p>

<p>
"I shall tell you how it came to pass,
monsieur; <i>you</i> will believe me?" said the
chevalier, turning to me earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly, monsieur."
</p>

<p>
"Our fleet is still shut up in Brest by
yours; so a large privateer of Bristol
made a dash into the harbour of
Cherbourg last week, to pick up anything
milord Howe had left behind him.  Among
other things they unluckily picked up me,
when on my way to Erville to keep an
appointment with a little <i>paysanne</i>, who,
like the rest, preferred a Parisian hussar
to a Breton woodcutter.  The privateer
put to sea; I was refused my parole of
honour, and placed on board this floating
pandemonium three days before she was
stranded in Rye Harbour, because in
resenting some insolence of the privateer
captain, I knocked him down and jumped
overboard.  He jumped after me, and we
fought in the water till a boat's-crew
picked us up.  <i>Pardieu</i> that is all, <i>mon
camerade</i>."
</p>

<p>
I begged the officer in command of the
<i>Alceste</i> to accept the parole of the chevalier,
to which he at once agreed, and removed
him to one of the after cabins, where he
was supplied with clothes to replace his
hussar uniform, which was now in rags,
the ruffians of the prison-ship having torn
every shred of lace from it, to exchange
for grog with bumboat women who
paddled about the frigate.
</p>

<p>
We had a bottle of wine together, and
under its influence the Frenchman's
natural gaiety soon resumed its wonted
sway, his annoyance and anger disappeared,
and as we conversed his voice brought
back, as in a mental panorama, the old
chateau on the road to Rennes, with its
reedy lake and flower-enamelled lawn&mdash;the
woods, the hills, and rockbound shores
of Brittany, with softer thoughts of a
time that would never come again&mdash;thoughts,
however, that he was singularly
fated to dispel.
</p>

<p>
"The story of your encounter with
Hautois, and your casting him into the
Black Torrent, where doubtless he has
thrown many an unfortunate devil, will
form one of the best legends in Brittany,"
said he, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"The old Countess Ninon?"
</p>

<p>
"Is well&mdash;though less blooming than
her namesake, De l'Enclos."
</p>

<p>
"And Urbain&mdash;and old Bertrand?"
</p>

<p>
"All well, when I saw them last, about
ten days ago.  <i>Peste!</i> what a number of
things have happened to me since then."
</p>

<p>
"And pretty Angelique?"
</p>

<p>
"Is now the happy wife of Jacquot
Triquot, coachman to M. le Curé of
St. Solidore.  The countess punished her thus
for her remarkable trick of turning you
into a soubrette, my friend, which might
have been a very serious joke!"
</p>

<p>
I smiled mournfully and muttered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Poor&mdash;poor Jacqueline!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu!</i> how is it that you do not ask
for her?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask for <i>her</i>?" I repeated, with sorrowful
surprise; "ask for one who is dead
and buried?"
</p>

<p>
"Who <i>was</i> half dead and half buried,
you mean.  She was only stunned by a
blow, and half-smothered among leaves
and grass.  She is alive and well, <i>Dieu
merci!</i> and by this time will be in Paris
with her cousin, Comte Bourgneuf."
</p>

<p>
I remained for some moments in doubt
of my senses on hearing this; but there
was an imperturbable smile on Boisguiller's
face, as he sat twirling each moustache
alternately.
</p>

<p>
"Chevalier, you assure me of this on
your honour," said I, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
"On my honour as an officer wearing
the cross of St. Louis.  It was a mere case
of suspended animation&mdash;nothing more.
You would have seen this yourself had
you not left us with the bloodhound in
such a devil of a hurry to follow the track
of Hautois.  In fact, she spoke to us all
quite rationally in about half an hour after
you disappeared."
</p>

<p>
"Chevalier, you saw how I suffered,"
said I, with grave reproach, "and yet you
permitted me to leave the province in the
belief that Jacqueline de Broglie was
indeed dead.  Was this fair of you?"
</p>

<p>
"In love as in war, my dear fellow, all
things are fair, so far as strategy will go.
Had I told you that she was merely in a
swoon&mdash;<i>lethargique</i>&mdash;you might have been
prompted to commit some new
extravagance; thus we all thought that the sooner
you were comfortably out of France the
better.  She is now in Paris, and&mdash;" he
added rather spitefully, for my manner
piqued him, "and will soon be married&mdash;most
suitably married."
</p>

<p>
"Married to whom?" I asked fiercely.
But he still smiled complacently, and
continued to curl his confounded moustache.
"In Paris&mdash;ah, there she may soon forget
<i>me</i>," I added, sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Forget you!  <i>Ouf, mon camarade!</i> what
would you have?  You don't know my
cousin Jacqueline.  In that huge old
barrack, the lonely chateau, you were a
brother, a companion, a little bit of
romance such as we may find in
Marivaux&mdash;nothing more.  In Paris, the memory of
all that will soon be effaced.  Monsieur,
she cannot come here&mdash;you cannot
go there&mdash;so this is the end of the
matter."  And he burst out into a fit of
laughter.
</p>

<p>
As a sequel to this conversation, my
mind became oppressed by emotions of a
very mingled cast indeed, and so little
desire had I for the stinging communications
of my friend the chevalier, that
my whole wish was to get rid of him
handsomely as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
I wrote to Captain Douglas and to
Lieutenant Keith to inform them how
and where I had found the brave officer
who had commanded in the redoubt at
Cancalle Bay, and had led those hussars
whom we had met hand to hand and
bridle to bridle in Brittany.
</p>

<p>
They used their influence with old
Colonel Preston, and through him the
chevalier in a short time effected an
exchange with an officer of equal rank, and
was sent home to France by cartel.
</p>

<p>
Prior to this, a subdivision of marines
having been placed on board the <i>Alceste</i>,
my party gladly marched back to headquarters
at Wadhurst, about twenty-five
miles from Rye.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap24"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
WADHURST.
</h3>

<p>
Jacqueline <i>not</i> dead, but in Paris!  It
terrified and bewildered me.  Was Hautois
drowned at last? might he too reappear
as he had done before, like a vampire,
whom there was no destroying?  Jacqueline
not dead, but in Paris with her
cousin, the handsome Comte de Bourgneuf,
to whom she was soon to be married.
This idea&mdash;this sequel to her story,
whether false or <i>true</i>, was ever before me,
kindling my jealousy, wounding my
self-esteem, filling my heart with bitter sorrow,
and I longed for active service to wean
me from myself; and right glad was I
when the "Route" arrived for Germany.
</p>

<p>
Wadhurst is five miles from Tunbridge
Wells.  That famous Spa was then little
more than a village, but many fashionables
who were there to drink the waters,
to kill time, to catch an heir or an
heiress, came over to see the corps
inspected by the general of the district on
the day before we marched for the coast.
</p>

<p>
The regiment paraded in complete
marching order, with valises packed, and
pouches filled with ammunition.  In
addition to the usual accoutrements for horse
and man, every officer and trooper had
strapped to his saddle a nosebag, watering
bridle and log, with mane and curry-combs,
sponge, horsepicker, scissors, and
spare shoe, all in a canvas cover, and a
net for forage.
</p>

<p>
We received the general, John Lafausille
(who four years after died when
on his way home from the Havannah), in
review order, with our trumpets sounding
"Britons, strike home."  And I can remember
well the stately appearance of the old
soldier, with his hair powdered and
queued, as he rode to the front of the staff,
and raised his Kevenhüller hat in salute,
while the veteran Preston, erect, grim,
and stiff, in his buff coat, a relic of a past
age retained by his eccentricity, lowered
his heavy broadsword in return till the
blade touched the toe of his right
jackboot.  The muscular strength and stature
of our men, nearly all of whom were
natives of Ayrshire, with the beauty and
high condition of our horses, excited great
admiration.
</p>

<p>
A brilliant staff now passed along the
line, and it was so numerous, that to
admit its passage, our rear rank went about
by threes, retired to double distance, then
fronted and dressed by the pivots.  Many
ladies on horseback accompanied the
staff.
</p>

<p>
Among them was one in a pale blue
riding-habit, with a broad hat and white
plume, who was mounted on a dashing
grey pad, and rode beside an aide-de-camp,
of whom she was asking many questions;
and she seemed to be eagerly scrutinizing
the corps, the officers thereof especially.
</p>

<p>
Her companion I knew by sight to be
a Major Shirley&mdash;rather a gay and
dissipated man, and a brother of that Cornet
Frederick Shirley who had wrought my
friend Charters such evil when in the
Dragoon Guards.
</p>

<p>
"Have you found him?" asked the
major, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"No," I heard the lady reply.
</p>

<p>
"Look among the cornets."
</p>

<p>
"But how shall I know them?"
</p>

<p>
"By their cake and pudding appearance.
Besides, each carries the standard of his
troop."
</p>

<p>
They were now close to me, and I
carried the standard of the Light Troop,
with the staff resting on the toe of my
right boot, so the young lady, a handsome
girl with fair, almost golden hair, a
delicate complexion, and dark blue eyes,
turned and looked fully at me.
</p>

<p>
She was my cousin Aurora!
</p>

<p>
Though it was for me she had been
looking, she coloured deeply, bowed and
smiled, and then grew pale&mdash;so pale that
her friend the staff major observed it, and
said, drily:
</p>

<p>
"So, Miss Gauntlet, you have found him, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;oh yes, and knew him immediately."
</p>

<p>
"Then I hope you are pleased," said
the major, biting his nether-lip and adroitly
catching the bridle of her horse, which
reared at a sudden crash of the trumpets
that drowned her reply as the cavalcade
passed on.
</p>

<p>
The ranks were now closed.
</p>

<p>
"Dress the line by the standards, Major
Maitland," cried Colonel Preston.  "Who
is that fool yonder throwing the whole
line out?" he added, as a sergeant's horse
became restive and reared on its hind
legs.
</p>

<p>
"A fool, but for whom, Colonel, you
would have been years ago in your
grave at Stapledyke," replied the sergeant,
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Egad you are right, Duff, for you
saved my life there&mdash;forgive my anger,
comrade," said the kind old officer.
</p>

<p>
"I would forgive you any thing, Colonel,"
replied the old sergeant in the same under
tone, while his eyes filled; "for you and
I are the last left of the Greys who rode
in the charge on the bloody day in South
Beveland."
</p>

<p>
The review was soon over; we passed
the general in open column of troops,
charged in squadrons and in line, amid
whirlwinds of dust&mdash;went through sword
and carbine exercise, were complimented
by the general and harangued by the
colonel; then the men were dismissed to
their quarters, while the officers joined the
staff and the ladies at luncheon, in a large
marquee which had been erected on a
pleasant lawn for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
A stranger amid that gay throng, and
caring little on the eve of embarkation
whether or not I made new acquaintances,
I was attending to one or two stout and
elderly mammas, who being neither
handsome nor blooming, had been somewhat
neglected; and while doing the honours
with our cold fowl, pink cream and
champagne, a voice close by me said:
</p>

<p>
"And so, Basil, you are going to the
seat of war?"
</p>

<p>
I looked around, and found Aurora
Gauntlet's blue eyes bent on me with
something of sad earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"You will shake hands with me,
Basil&mdash;won't you?"
</p>

<p>
I coloured and trembled with pride,
perplexity, and even annoyance; but
pressed her hand in mine, though the
wrongs I had suffered at the behest of our
grandfather swelled up bitterly in my heart.
</p>

<p>
"So, Basil," she resumed, smiling, "I
have brought your military escapade to a
creditable&mdash;to a pleasant termination;
have I not?"
</p>

<p>
"I felt quite certain, Miss Gauntlet, that
it was to you I owed my epaulettes, and
I pray you to accept of my gratitude for
your friendship and memory.  My military
escapade!  Is it thus you term the resource
of stern necessity?  Would it have been
an escapade had I turned highwayman,
or joined some desperate privateer?  Few
resources are left to a penniless gentleman,
so I chose the most honourable."
</p>

<p>
"I deplore your bitterness of spirit,
cousin Basil," said she, "and I pity you;
but what could&mdash;what <i>can</i> I do?"
</p>

<p>
"I ask no pity, Miss Gauntlet," I replied,
somewhat ruffled; "but permit me to lead
you from this&mdash;here we cannot converse
with freedom."  And taking her hand,
we went forth into the sunny lawn,
Aurora holding her riding-habit gathered
in her left hand, her ostrich feather
drooping over her right shoulder, and very
lovely and graceful she looked in the
bloom of her youth and beauty.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me," said she, almost with
tears in her eyes, and a quiver on her
pouting lip, for she knew in what a hostile
aspect I viewed her; "but I think your
conduct to me, as a kinswoman who seeks to
befriend you, most unkind and ungracious!
Think of what is before you, and that we
may never see or meet each other again."
</p>

<p>
I laughed and replied,
</p>

<p>
"We have not seen much of each other
hitherto, Miss Gauntlet."
</p>

<p>
"Call me Aurora!" said she, grasping
her switch with an impulse that was not
all playfulness.
</p>

<p>
"But then, when I am such a scape-grace&mdash;outcast
if you will&mdash;what the devil
does it matter what is before me, or how
soon I am shot?  Thanks to you, however,
my dear cousin, I shall die in the position
of a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"I would have sent you a few hundred
guineas on your promotion, Basil; but
mamma reminded me of your dangerous
pride, your haughty and resentful spirit,
so I tore up the cheque after signing it."
</p>

<p>
"You judged rightly, my dear cousin;
but I thank you, though I would not
have accepted the money.  The commission
you have thrust upon me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thrust&mdash;oh fie, Basil!  It was simply
managed," said she, smiling, "by a note
from mamma to Mr. Pitt, the great
commoner, who was once himself a cornet of
cavalry; in the Blues, I think, was he
not?"
</p>

<p>
"That commission I hoped to have won
otherwise.  However&mdash;&mdash;" I paused, as
there was a tearful and angry expression
in Aurora's eyes, and very beautiful eyes
they were, with lashes thick, dark, and
long, which imparted to them a charming
softness.  Then cousinship is such
a strange affinity&mdash;something like a
sister and more like a sweetheart, that I
committed some very ungracious speech
to silence, for I now began to perceive
that from her mother Aurora inherited a
true English girl's face, in expression the
sweetest, in features the softest, perhaps,
in the world.
</p>

<p>
"And you march&mdash;&mdash;" she began, to
change the subject.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow, at eight in the morning."
</p>

<p>
"So early!  Yet I shall ride over from
Tunbridge Wells to see you off."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Aurora; but at such an hour&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shall not want for an escort,
believe me.  Major Shirley and a dozen
others will only be too happy.  And now
that we are to be friends from henceforward,
confess that you have been wrong, cousin
Basil, and that I have been right!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps&mdash;it is the privilege of all
handsome girls to be right, whatever view
they take."
</p>

<p>
"Did you learn this in France?" she
asked, with a steady glance.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said I, and with the thought of
Jacqueline, my heart seemed to die within
me; "in France I preserved your
handkerchief (you remember our race on
Banstead Heath), and it saved my life
from a bullet at St. Malo."
</p>

<p>
Her soft, peachlike cheek flushed with
honest pleasure when I said this, but ere
she could reply, Major Shirley&mdash;a
privileged man evidently was this devil of a
major, and a very handsome one to
boot&mdash;came forward, saying&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Miss Gauntlet, I beg pardon, but I
have been looking for you everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked Aurora, raising her eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"You are forgetting the hour, and that
I promised your mamma to see you safely
back to Tunbridge Wells betimes."
</p>

<p>
"Adieu, Basil!"
</p>

<p>
"Till to-morrow," I added.
</p>

<p>
She kissed her gloved hand to me, and the
smiling major led her away with all haste.
</p>

<p>
I was happier after this interview than
I had been for many a day.  The kindness
that the warmhearted and impulsive
Aurora seemed to cherish for me gave her
another and a nearer interest in my mind.
Animosity died within me, and I began
to think it was charming to have at least
one relation who loved me for myself, and
I thought of our old Scottish proverb,
which says that "Blood is thicker than
water."  Moreover, how could she help
the tenor of my crusty grandfather's odious
will, or that fatality by which my cousin
Tony broke his valuable neck and made
her an heiress?
</p>

<p>
We paraded duly for the march next
day.  The several troops were formed,
their rolls called, and as the clock of the
old market-place struck eight, the whole
regiment moved off amid the cheers of the
populace and the lamentations of those
soldiers' wives who were left behind with
their poor little ones, their treasured
marriage lines, and a "begging pass" to their
own parish wherever it might be&mdash;too
often the usual and cruel wind-up of
military matrimony.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Aurora Gauntlet,
mounted on her dashing grey&mdash;a pad
she rode in compliment to <i>us</i>&mdash;her cheeks
flushed by a long ride in the pure
morning air, her skirt and plume and golden
hair floating behind her, cantered up to
the column, accompanied by Major Shirley
in his staff uniform, and by John Trot,
the valiant hero of Wandsworth Common,
in very gay livery, and like the staff
officer, well mounted.
</p>

<p>
"I'm just in time, I find," said she, as
I drew aside from my troop (which being
the Light one was in the rear, as the corps
was marched with the right in front) and
reined up beside her.
</p>

<p>
"I was looking for you anxiously,
Aurora.  Will you keep this document
for me, cousin? for if I am killed in
Germany, I have no desire that it should be
used by some boor to light his pipe with
or wrap his butter in."
</p>

<p>
It was the diploma of the Netherwood
baronetcy, running in the name of
"CAROLUS, DEI GRATIA, REX SCOTIÆ ET
ANGLIÆ, &amp;c. &amp;c., <i>nostro Johanni Gauntleti
de Netherwood, ejusque hæredibus masculis
de corpore, &amp;c., titulam gradum et dignitatem
militis Baronetti in hac antiqua parte Regni
Nostri Scotiæ,</i>" and so forth.
</p>

<p>
"You shall be the custodier of this
choice piece of archæology, for with my
sword, Aurora, it is all my inheritance
now.  In my haversack or valise I have
borne it ever since old Nathan Wylie, Sir
Basil's evil mentor, sent it to me as a
taunt amid my misfortunes."
</p>

<p>
"You would still reproach me?" said
she, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Aurora, on my soul I do not."
</p>

<p>
"I thank you," she replied, with her
eyes brimful of tears; for in addition to
the peculiar position in which we stood,
nothing melts a woman's heart so much
as the aspect of a fine regiment departing
for foreign service in time of war.  "My
mother has become feeble and ailing&mdash;I
shall soon be alone in the world, so think
kindly of me, Basil, when you are far
away, even as we shall think kindly of
you, for we are the last of our
family&mdash;the last of the old Gauntlets of Netherwood."
</p>

<p>
"I am, rather than you," said I, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Some one, of course, will marry you,
so I must be the last."
</p>

<p>
She blushed painfully, and her glance
wandered to Shirley, but his <i>eyes</i>, at least,
appeared to be intent upon the marching
column.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to Germany now, perhaps
never to return; for news I have heard
(here I referred to the strange tidings of
Boisguiller) have made me, even in youth,
somewhat reckless of life."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Basil, Basil! you must not speak thus."
</p>

<p>
"Sir, Colonel Preston is looking back
for <i>you</i>," said Major Shirley, with a slight
tone of impatience and authority in his
voice.  "And there sounds a trumpet."
</p>

<p>
"Then we do part friends at last?" said
Aurora, with a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear cousin, the best of friends."
</p>

<p>
She held up her cheek to be kissed by
me; but somehow her rosy lip came in its
place.
</p>

<p>
I saw Shirley's face darken, but heeded
it little, as I put spurs to my grey and
dashed after the regiment, which was now
trotting along the highway which led
towards Brighton.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
SAIL FOR GERMANY.
</h3>

<p>
We had been very comfortable in our quiet
country quarters in Sussex, and being so
near London, our officers led a gay life,
for at least one-half of them were always
in town "between returns;" but now
Ranelagh and Vauxhall, with their fireworks
and lighted promenades, their belles,
beaux, music, and gaiety; the <i>ridotti</i>,
the opera, the theatres, and entertainments
<i>al fresco</i> in the beautiful West-end parks,
or by barges up the Thames to Richmond
or to Hampton Court, were all to be
exchanged for the long dusty march by day
or the dark and weary one by night&mdash;the
tented camp, the wet bivouac, and the
perils of the German war.
</p>

<p>
The regiment was embarked on board
of two frigates&mdash;the <i>Venus</i> and <i>Thames</i>.
The Light Troop was in the latter, under
Major Maitland.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the circumstances of the
expedition, and that the frigates, after
landing us, were to run down the Channel and
join the Brest blockading fleet, under
Anson and Howe, discipline was somewhat
relaxed, and the seamen and marines were
permitted the privilege of having their
wives, sweethearts, and friends on board.
So there were enough, and to spare, of
singing and weeping, swearing, smoking,
and even fighting between decks.
</p>

<p>
To most of us the atmosphere, especially
below, was rendered insupportable by
the mingled odours of bilge, coarse
tobacco, purser's gin, and new paint,
while the language heard on every side
was neither classical nor poetical; and this
continued until the Blue Peter appeared
fluttering from the frigate's foremasthead,
and the boom of one of her bow-chasers
announced that all shore-people must leave.
Then began the howling of women and
the grumbling of the seamen, many of
whom, to express their discontent, roared
in chorus a song then popular among
taverns and crimping-houses, a portion of
which ran thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Ere Hawke did bang Mounseer Conflan,<br />
  We had plenty of beef and beer;<br />
  <i>Now</i> Mounseer's beat, we've little to eat,<br />
  And d&mdash;&mdash;n the drop of gin so neat,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since John Bull's nought to fear."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
After having most severe weather at
sea, we were landed at the quaint, old, and
Dutch-like town of Embden, about the
middle of September.
</p>

<p>
There we remained two days, giving our
horses gentle exercise after the cramps of
the sea voyage, riding them by the long
canals which intersect the city, and by the
sluices of which the whole surrounding
country can be inundated in time of war.
The officers received a banquet from the
burgomaster and Count of Embden in the
old feudal castle of the latter, and then we
marched to join the allied British and
Hanoverians, who were now commanded
by Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick.
</p>

<p>
I shall never forget that route, which
occupied ten days.  The rain poured
incessantly, and we had to traverse a low,
marshy country, few portions of which
were less than fetlock deep in water.
Many of the towns we passed through had
been destroyed; the inhabitants of others
declined to be incommoded.  Thus we
frequently bivouacked amid the wet, being
quite without tents; but old Colonel
Preston always cheered us on.  Sometimes
he would say, as some of us nodded over
our holsters, when riding wearily on in the
grey dawn that heralded another day of
toil and travel:
</p>

<p>
"You are weary, my gude lads; we
shall halt in an hour; but there can be no
sleep even then, unless with the sword in
the hand and the foot in the stirrup."
</p>

<p>
On one of those wretched marches I had
command of the regimental baggage-guard,
and was hourly annoyed by the master
waggoner, an East Frieslander, who was
never sober, as he drank constantly from a
keg of Schiedam which hung at the back
of his wain, and his companions assured
me that he had never been sober for a
year&mdash;others averred that he had been born
drunk, so great a toper was he.  I was
riding a little way in rear of the escort,
which was traversing a fetid swamp from
whence a pestilential evening mist was
rising white as milk, when amid that
gloomy vapour there suddenly rose in front
a lambent light of a pale hue.  Then a
cry of dismay from Hob Elliot and others
of my men, made me trot up to the spot,
where I beheld a very appalling spectacle.
</p>

<p>
The Friesland waggoner was lying on
his back, and literally on fire&mdash;flames
were issuing from his crackling nostrils,
mouth, and ears, and even, while we
gazed on him, his whole face and hair
were burned away, while the fire seemed
to pass over his whole body, scorching
his clothes to powder.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Lancelot Probe, our surgeon, came
speedily back from the front, but the
Frieslander was already beyond his skill,
having expired in agony.  It was a
case of spontaneous combustion.  Probe
naturally conjectured that a spark from
his pipe&mdash;which he yet firmly grasped&mdash;had
ignited the fumes of the spirit within
him, and the subtle gases issuing from
every pore and orifice, had kindled at
once to fire, on reaching the external air.
</p>

<p>
Be it as it may, the terrible episode of
the Frieslander had the effect of keeping
some of our most tipsy fellows sober for
many a week after.
</p>

<p>
Our mode of passing the night was
generally thus.
</p>

<p>
A ridge would be selected; we dismounted
and cloaked, throwing a portion
over the saddle and holsters, each man
standing by his horse, and holding on by
the stirrup leather to steady himself if
sleeping, as he was pretty sure to be.
Despite the danger of lying down among
the horses' hoofs, some did so in utter
weariness, but were soon forced to get up
again, lest their own chargers should
tread on them.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, a dragoon accoutred cannot
lie on his back for the spurs that are on
his heels, and the cartridge-box between
his shoulders, nor on his right side for his
haversack, nor on his left for his canteen
and sword-hilt; thus, when harnessed, he
has no resource but to sleep on his face
with his nose and toes in the turf!
</p>

<p>
So the dreary night would pass&mdash;the
trumpet pour its melancholy twang
through the mist at daybreak, and amid
the pestilential swamp we would groom
our horses or imagine that we did so;
pour the water out of our boots; partake
of a ration biscuit soaked by the night
rain to pulp, if nothing better could be
had; denounce the Hanoverians for whom
we, H.M. Scots Greys, endured all this
discomfort, and then again resume the
march, which ended on the 31st of
September, when we joined Prince Ferdinand
at Coesveldt, a small but fortified town in
Westphalia.
</p>

<p>
On those long marches, Tom Kirkton&mdash;he
had now attained the rank of
troop-sergeant&mdash;and I had many a confab as of
old, for on service rank makes little
difference, if discipline be retained.  He
frequently and bluntly urged that I
should "lay siege," as he phrased it, "to
my pretty cousin, and marry her, and so
quit this miserable work.  Lay siege!"
he added, on one occasion; "you don't
require to do that, for I have no doubt she
is anxious enough to hook you for the
mere sake of being Lady Gauntlet."
</p>

<p>
"This is most flattering, Tom; and so
you would have me pander to a spirit so
mercenary.  Nay, nay; I cannot judge of
her thus; and by this time perhaps she
is the wife of Major Shirley, whom I left
in possession of the field."
</p>

<p>
But Tom's advice, though heedlessly
given, always rankled long and bitterly
in my mind.
</p>

<p>
And now, lest the reader may naturally
inquire what object we had in making a
tour of Germany, I may briefly state
that his Britannic Majesty's native and
well-beloved Electorate of Hanover had
been overrun by a French army, to expel
whom, Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick
had put himself at the head of the
German troops, and to reinforce these, six
regiments of British infantry and some
cavalry had joined him, and were now
under the command of Lord George Sackville.
Since the accession of the house
of Guelph to the throne, the whole taxes
and energies of the British people had
been systematically devoted to the defence
of Hanover and the pauper princelings of
Germany; just as in the preceding age
they had been wasted in defence of King
William's dearly-beloved Dutch; and it
was not until the peace of Paris that, as
an historian says, the nation "would no
longer suffer the public treasure to be
squandered on poor foreign princes under
the name of subsidies, to enable them to
fight their own battles, nor the blood of
British soldiers to be spilt to water
the forests and fertilize the plains of
Germany."
</p>

<p>
However, these are after-thoughts; of
such we took little heed then, and cared
less whom we fought, or where, remembering
only a soldier's first duty&mdash;implicit
obedience.
</p>

<p>
I shall briefly state that we skirmished
through all Westphalia; that during these
operations I received a slight pistol wound
in the bridle hand; Colonel Preston had
a horse shot under him, and Tom Kirkton
a standard pole broken by a grape-shot,
and so forth, until the month of November,
when we retired to winter quarters
at the little city of Alphen, in the
Bishopric of Paderborn, where we remained
quietly recruiting our energies for a new
struggle in the early part of the ensuing
year.
</p>

<p>
The allies, 34,000 strong, were led, as
I have stated, by Ferdinand of Brunswick,
one of the most celebrated generals of the
age; but opposed to him were two
maréchals of France, one, whose name
found an echo in my heart, the Duc de
Broglie, and the other M. de Contades,
with 60,000 troops, the flower of the
French line&mdash;men at whose hands the
British and Hanoverians had suffered a
series of reverses which made us long for
spring, that the contest might be renewed
and ended for ever.

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
